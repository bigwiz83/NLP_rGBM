The study examines, in four sequential treatment groups, the effect of dose, hypofractionation and treatment volume on toxicity. Upon completion of the phase I part, the study progresses to phase II where the best dose- and treatment regimen will be chosen for treatment.

At progression, treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective. Bevacizumab was approved for recurrent GBM patients. Topotecan is an orally bioavailable topoisomerase I and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha inhibitor with reasonably high central nervous system (CNS)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration. Recent pre-clinical reports have begun to argue for the clinical testing of metronomic chemotherapy administration in various cancers."

Treatment options include repeat surgery, re-irradiation, or chemotherapy. VAL-083, Dianhydrogalactitol (DAG), unlike temozolomide, is unlike temozolmide, is not a chemotherapy drug. It is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been shown to improve the prognosis of patients with GBM.

This study is comprised of patients who have failed standard of care treatment (maximal safe resection followed by chemoradiation). Clinical response will be evaluated by neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing, and imaging studies as well as by histological examination wherever a re-operation is clinically indicated. Blood samples will be taken for systemic immunological response, blood counts and liver functions tests."

The study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib with or without anticonvulsant drugs known to be metabolized by the P450 hepatic enzyme complex in patients with recurrent glioma. It was also designed to determine the biologic activity of this drug by measuring proteasome 20S activity in these patients.

VB-111 has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of cancer. Information from these studies suggest that it may be beneficial for recurrent or progressive glioblastoma. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved this intervention for recurrent or progressiveglioblastoma, but it may be beneficial in the future. It works by targeting and damaging the blood vessels that grow and nourish cancerous tumors leading to tumor starvation."

Erlotinib is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface of many tumor cells that may control tumor growth and survival. Temozolomide is designed to kill cancer cells by damaging DNA (the genetic material of cells). The damaged DNA may cause tumor cell death. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first 3 participants in each group will receive the lowest dose level. Each 3 will remain in the same group for the entire study. Up to 4 dose levels of study drug combinations will be tested in Group 1, up to 2 dose levels in Group 2."
