3,"Pre- and Postoperative Use of ZD1839 (Iressa) in Recurrent Glioblastoma, Including Translational Research",NCT00250887,"Glioblastoma (GBM) patients who relapse and are in good performance status, without serious neurological deficits are offered secondary surgery and participation in the trial. Eligible patients must have had standard treatment including primary surgery, radiation therapy and at least a first line chemotherapy. Patients on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAE) are excluded due to ensuing interactions of these drugs with gefitinib metabolism, reducing systemic availability. After giving written informed consent, patients receive gefitinib 500 mg daily starting at least 5 days prior to re-operation, allowing a steady state condition.Treatment continues until tumor progression or occurrence of intolerable side effects.The specimens collected at surgery will undergo translational research, aiming to correlate drug accumulation and molecular signatures of GBM samples with clinical outcome."
4,A Phase 2 Study of PLX3397 in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT01349036,The objective of this study is to evaluate the response of subjects with recurrent glioblastoma to continuous therapy of PLX3397.
5,Ketogenic Diet for Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT00575146,"Increased glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphorylation is a characteristic property of many tumors. A change of nutrition by limiting carbohydrates and increasing the proportion of fatty acids and proteins can lead to ketogenic metabolism and might limit energy production in tumor cells and therefore inhibit tumor growth. Standard treatment for glioblastoma includes resection, irradiation and temozolomide chemotherapy. If there is tumor recurrence, no standard therapy is established. Therapeutic options in this situation include resection, irradiation or another chemotherapy. However, some patients cannot be treated in this situation, because none of the available treatment options seems reasonable or applicable, for example if no additional chemotherapy can be started at the time of recurrence due to myelosuppression. The pilot study examines whether in this situation a ketogenic diet can be applied to the patients and may inhibit tumor growth and influence the quality of life of the patients."
6,Phase Ib/II Study of Buparlisib Plus Carboplatin or Lomustine in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT01934361,"This is a multi-center, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients that had recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. The first part (phase Ib) was to investigate the maximum tolerated dose/Recommended phase ll dose (MTD/RP2D) of once daily buparlisib in combination with every-three-week carboplatin or buparlisib once daily in combination with every-six-week lomustine (CCNU) using a Bayesian model. Once MTD/ RP2D is established in either of the 2 arms, the corresponding phase II portion of the study was to start. Phase II was to assess the treatment effect of buparlisib in combination with carboplatin in terms of Progression Free Survival (PFS) and was to compare the treatment effect of buparlisib with lomustine versus lomustine plus placebo in terms of PFS.  A preliminary assessment for both combinations (buparlisib plus carboplatin or lomustine) demonstrated that there was not enough antitumor activity compared to historical data with single agent carboplatin or lomustine. Based on the overall safety profile, and preliminary anti-tumor activity observed in this study, Novartis decided that no additional patients would be enrolled into this study. As a consequence, the Phase II part of the study was not conducted."
7,Ketogenic Diet Adjunctive to Salvage Chemotherapy for Recurrent Glioblastoma:a Pilot Study,NCT02939378,"Diet change by limiting carbohydrates and increasing the proportion of fatty acids and proteins can lead to ketogenic metabolism and might limit energy production in tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth.  In a pilot of recurrent glioblastoma, ketogenic diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given as interventional group and standard diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given as control group.  The study examines whether a ketogenic diet adjunctive to salvage chemotherapy can be applied to the patients and may inhibit tumor growth and influence the quality of life of the patients."
8,Trial to Evaluate the Safety of TTAC-0001(Tanibirumab) in Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT03033524,"Study Design - Multicenter, open-label, 3 arms, stepwise, phase ¥±a clinical trial  Study objective:  Primary - To evaluate the safety of TTAC-0001 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

A safety review committee (SRC) will convene to determine the patient's safety with a decision on enrollment into the next arm or change in dosing frequency of study drug in the above case.  A patient who is withdrawn from the study before the completion of the 1st cycle can be replaced with another patient. Patients will be treated for up to 1 year, unless a cause for termination occurs, such as progression of disease (PD) or the withdrawal of consent."
9,BIBF 1120 in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT01251484,"VEGF inhibition by BEV may induce a change in tumor invasiveness and treatment failure is often associated with remote metastases. BEV may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Cediranib, a pan-VEGF inhibitor has shown promising results in recurrent GBM.  VEGF-blocking with small molecules may overcome the mechanism of resistance, and response to BIBF-1120 in such circumstances may open a new treatment option in GBM. In additional, recurrent glioblastomas have an extremely poor prognosis, so innovative therapies are needed."
10,TTAC-0001 and Pembrolizumab Combination phase1b Trial in Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT03722342,"This is a phase 1b, open-Label clinical trial to determine the safety and tolerability and to establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TTAC-0001 administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent glioblastoma."

15,Cediranib in Combination With Lomustine Chemotherapy in Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT00777153,"The purpose of this study is to see how effective cediranib is in treating a brain tumour called recurrent glioblastoma. Two drugs are being tested in this study. Lomustine is an approved oral chemotherapy that belongs to the class of drugs called alkylating agents. Cediranib is a new drug that has not yet been approved for this disease. This study will compare the use of lomustine with cediranib, cediranib alone or lomustine with placebo (""inactive substance"") to see whether the combination or cediranib alone will be more effective than the chemotherapy alone (lomustine) in preventing the growth of cancer cells."

17,"Calorie-restricted, Ketogenic Diet and Transient Fasting During Reirradiation for Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma",NCT01754350,"Increased glucose metabolism is characteristic for solid tumors. Thereby, glucose is important for the generation of ATP, supply of anabolic substrates and defense against reactive oxygen species in tumor cells. In preclinical models, restricting glucose availability using a ketogenic diet, calorie-restriction or transient fasting inhibits tumor growth.  Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate whether a calorie-restricted, ketogenic diet and transient fasting can enhance the efficacy of reirradiation in patients with recurrent glioblastoma."

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for a minimum of 12 weeks and until disease progression."
19,Clinical Trial on the Combination of Avelumab and Axitinib for the Treatment of Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT03291314,"High-grade gliomas of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by profound tumor related neo-angiogenesis, and intracranial perilesional edema. Glioblastoma (WHO-grade IV glioma) expresses high levels of VEGF and frequently carries an amplified gene copy numbers of the VEGFR2, KIT and PDGFR or EGFR genes, key mediators of the process of cancer related neo-angiogenesis. In patient diagnosed with recurrence/progression glioblastoma (recGB) following prior therapy with surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide, cytotoxic salvage therapies resulted in a best overall response rate of 5 to 10%, 6-month PFS rates of 9% to 21%, and a median OS of 25 to 30 weeks. No treatment option has demonstrated to improve the survival expectancy of recGB patients in a randomized clinical trial. Bevacizumab treatment has been registered by FDA based on objective tumor response rates and PFS results obtained in uncontrolled phase II trials. There is currently no treatment registered by EMA for the indication of recGB.  Axitinib, a VEGFR-specific small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Tki) has demonstrated anti-tumor activity when evaluated as a mono-therapy and in combination with lomustine for the treatment of patients with recGB (EudraCT 2011-000900-16). Immunocytochemical profiling of the peripheral blood of recurrent GBM patients treated with axitinib or axitinib plus lomustine showed that axitinib treatment increases the number of naive CD8+ T cells and central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. There was also a reduction of TIM3 expression and an increased cytokine production in the patients treated with axitinib. Upon progression during axitinib treatment patients displayed an increased immune suppression with an increased number of Treg, an increased PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and a reduced T cell functionality.  Avelumab (MSB00107; anti-PD-L1) is a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in several tumor types. Expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been correlated with a higher probability for respons to avelumab throughout different tumor types. Glioblastoma has been reported to expresses the PD-L1 ligand.  In preclinical mouse models we demonstrated that axitinib reduces the immune suppressive microenvironment through reduction of the suppressive capacity of monocytic MDSCs (both in intra-cranial as well as subcutaneous tumors). Moreover, it also increased the number of tumor-infiltrating T cells. When we combined axitinib with active immunotherapy in the form of CTLA4 blockade not only a supplementary reduction of the suppressive capacity of these monocytic MDSCs was found, but also a reduction of the intratumoral granulocytic MDSCs and an increased antigen-presenting function of intratumoral DCs (manuscript accepted for publication in High-grade gliomas of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by profound tumor related neo-angiogenesis, and intracranial perilesional edema.

The rational for combining avelumab with for the treatment of recGB is based on the potential of axitinib to normalize the glioblastoma associated neo-vasculature, counteracting the immunosuppressive role of VEGF in the tumor microenvironment and controlling intracranial edema. These features may result in a synergistic anti-tumor effect with the PD-L1 inhibitory mAb avelumab. In addition, axitinib may reduce the inflammatory edema related to the anti-tumor effect mediated by PD-L1 inhibition with avelumab.  Patients with recGBM often develop neurological symptoms related to perilesional edema. Corticosteroids are considered a standard of care for controlling intracranial edema in patients with glioblastoma. High dose corticosteroids however are known to be immunosuppressive and are likely to counteract the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy. Axitinib has the capacity to control recGBM associated edema of the brain. Out of the 32 patients who were treated with corticosteroids at baseline in the AxiG trial (EudraCT 2011-000900-16) 17 could lower and 5 could stop their steroids during treatment with axitinib. PFS was identical for patient with or without need for steroids at baseline in the AxiG trial but OS was numerically superior for patients not in need for steroids at baseline."
20,FMISO PET Study of Glioblastoma,NCT02076152,"This study does not add any additional treatment to patients with malignant glioma who are already scheduled to receive bevacizumab monotherapy. All treatment decisions will be at the discretion of the treating physician. There will be no change in the diagnosis or management of the patient based on any procedures or tests carried out as a part of this study.  If the participant chooses to take part in this research study each treatment cycle will last 28 days.  Day 1-The participant will have the following procedures done before they can receive bevacizumab:  An assessment of the participant's tumor by Vascular MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and FMISO-PET scans Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.  Day 14:The participant will have the following procedures done after they receive bevacizumab:  An assessment of the participant's tumor by Vascular MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and FMISO-PET scans before the participant have received bevacizumab Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.  Day 28: The participant will have the following procedures done after they receive bevacizumab:  An assessment of the participant's tumor by Vascular MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and FMISO-PET scans after the participant has received bevacizumab Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.  FMISO-PET Scans:  The participant will have the scans performed in Charlestown, MA at the Martinos Center. The participant will be injected with two separate intravenous (IV) injections (listed below). Intravenous means a need will be injected into a vein in the participant's arm.  FMISO for PET scan and a contrast dye for the MRI scan Drawing blood to assess the radioactivity of FMISO The PET scan will take approximately 60-75 minutes. The participant will receive one injection of FMISO. Following the injection of the radiotracer, blood samples will be taken from the second IV line. The tracer is given through a vein (IV) and travels through the participant's blood and collects in organs and tissues. The participant will need to wait nearby as the tracer is absorbed by the their body. This takes about 90 minutes. Then, the participant will lie on a narrow table that slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET will pick up signals from the tracer and a computer will change the signals into 3D pictures that will be displayed on a monitor for the participant's study doctor to read.  MRI Scan:  MRI scans will last about 60-75 minutes. This will occur at the same time as the PET scan. The participant will be injected with contrast dye twice during the MRI scan. The participant will have 3 MRI scans (prior to starting treatment, day 1 of treatment and day 14 of treatment) that would not have routinely been performed if the participant were not participating in this study. Blood samples will be collected during both scans in order to measure how the participant blood vessels are processing the radiotracer FMISO and how well it is being delivered to the tumor tissue. The participant will be assessed for side effects via clinic visit or phone call about 24 hours after each of the visits above.  Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to call the participant every 3 months for three years after the 28 day visit to see how they are doing and if the participant is experiencing any side effects. If the participant is removed from the study due to an unacceptable side effect, the participant will be followed until it has been resolved."
21,TRC105 for Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT01778530,"Background:  TRC105 is an anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to CD105 (Endoglin), a transmembrane glycoprotein that is essential for angiogenesis, and expressed abundantly on activated vascular endothelial cells (ECs). CD105 is a member of the transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta) receptor superfamily, and modulates TGF-Beta signaling leading to EC proliferation and migration. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that CD105 is preferentially expressed in blood vessels of tumor tissues as compared with normal mucosa. For patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), increased expression of CD105 may correspond to worse survival times. Furthermore, expression of CD105 is essential for neovascularization, and is upregulated in the setting of (vascular endothelial growth factor ) VEGF inhibition. TRC105 binding to CD105 leads to inhibition of EC proliferation, neovascularization, and induces cell death via apoptosis. TRC105 may also mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).  Objectives:  Primary  To determine the radiographic response rate for patients with recurrent GBM treated with TRC105. To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in patients with GBM, as determined by progression free survival.  Secondary  To obtain information regarding the safety of TRC105 in patients with recurrent GBM. To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients while on treatment with TRC105. To examine the effect of TRC105 on vascular permeability as measured by percent change from baseline in the forward contrast transfer rate (Ktrans) of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). To examine the effect of TRC105 on vascular perfusion as measured by percent change from baseline in cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT) of dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI). To examine the effect of TRC105 on water diffusion as measured by percent change from baseline in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To examine the effect of TRC105 on tumor metabolism as measured by percent change from baseline in fludeoxyglucose F18 injection (FDG) uptake of positron emission tomography (PET) scan. To obtain preliminary data regarding how changes in serial FDG-PET scans and physiological MRI correlate with radiographic response rates and with progression free survival in patients treated with TRC105.  Eligibility:  -This is a phase II trial in patients with recurrent GBM who are VEGF therapy naive.  Design:  -Prior to treatment start, patients will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including MRI perfusion and diffusion scans, as well as an FDG-PET scan. Patients will then receive TRC105 as a single agent (weekly dose of 10 mg/kg IV). A cycle will consist of 4 weeks of therapy. At the end of the first cycle, the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and FDG-PET scans will be repeated before continuing treatment. Patients who are clinically and neurologically stable, and who have radiographic stable or responding disease at the end of each cycle will continue treatment with TRC105. MRI perfusion and diffusion will be repeated after the completion of each cycle of therapy."
22,Mycophenolate Mofetil Combined With Radiation Therapy in Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT04477200,"The goal of the Phase 0 component is to determine if MMF achieves active concentrations in brain tumors. Eight participants in Phase 0 will receive MMF for one week before undergoing an already planned biopsy or re-resection (surgical removal) of glioblastoma (GBM). A small portion of the tumor, removed as part of clinical care, will be used for testing in this study. Thirty additional participants will be enrolled in the Phase 1 component of the trial. The goal of the Phase 1 component is to find the dose of MMF that works best without causing severe side effects (the maximum tolerated dose) when combined with radiation. Participants in Phase 0 who meet the eligibility criteria for the Phase 1 component may participate in both phases."
23,Bi-weekly Temozolomide Plus Bevacizumab for Adult Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT00883298,"This is a phase II study of the combination of Avastin and temozolomide for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Avastin is administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 every 28 days and temozolomide is administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5 and 15-19 every 28 days (one cycle). Patients will have a baseline MRI, an MRI scan after the first cycle and every other cycle after that. If there is no evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients will receive one year of therapy. If there is evidence of added benefit (eg: tumor regression), patients can stay on treatment longer than one year, per investigator discretion."
24,Optune(NOVOTTF-100A)+ Bevacizumab+ Hypofractionated Stereotactic Irradiation Bevacizumab-Naive Recurrent Glioblastoma (GCC 1344),NCT01925573,"The combination of Optune(NovoTTF) with the active regimen of bevacizumab and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy bases the addition of an effective new treatment in the setting of a safe regimen with favorable survival reports. To date, no clinical data are available on the interaction of concomitant tumor treating fields with radiation therapy either with or without bevacizumab. TTF and radiation both have the potential to enhance the other's therapeutic ratio though synergistic mechanisms of action. The addition of bevacizumab to this regimen has both therapeutic and improved-toxicity implications. A trial combining Optune with the proven regimen of HFSRT and bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma affords an avenue to demonstrate safety in a population who may more readily derive a benefit from novel multimodality therapy and explore the potential for synergistic effect. The endpoint of efficacy would clearly need to be more definitively addressed in a future categorical trial, which would be the logical positive outcome of this pilot study."
25,Personalized Cellular Vaccine for Recurrent Glioblastoma (PERCELLVAC2),NCT02808364,"This is an open label, single-arm, single-institution, Phase I study designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular vaccines for patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Recurrent GBM patients will undergo tumor resection. The tumors will be analyzed for the expression of a panel of glioma-associated antigens and immune-related genes. Patients will undergo leukapheresis to collect mononuclear cells for DC generation. Based on the expression profiles of tumor-associated antigens, in vitro transcribed mRNA will be generated to pulse autologous DCs. Patients will be conditioned with immune adjuvants before and during immunization. Patients will receive biweekly vaccines. The antitumor specific T cell responses will be measured. Safety and efficacy will be monitored. The objective is to assess the safety of the personalized cellular vaccines and T cell responses. The efficacy of the vaccines will be evaluated using iRANO criteria, progression-free survival and overall survival."
26,Phase I Study of a Dendritic Cell Vaccine for Patients With Either Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02010606,"This phase I study for patients with either newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma with minimal residual tumor utilizes a dendritic cell vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic cells that have been pulsed with a lysate derived from an allogeneic glioblastoma stem-like cell line cultured under neurosphere-forming conditions.  Patients will receive a series of four vaccines given weekly during the Induction phase, followed by vaccinations every 8 weeks during the Maintenance phase for as long as patients remain on the study or until the vaccine supply is depleted. In addition to the investigative treatment, patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will receive standard temozolomide chemotherapy and radiation treatment, with the Induction phase beginning at the conclusion of radiation. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma will not receive treatment other than the investigative treatment, unless they were previously treated with bevacizumab, in which case they will be allowed to continue receiving bevacizumab."
27,Feasibility of Individualized Therapy for Recurrent GBM,NCT03681028,"This is a pilot, single-institution, single cohort, non-randomized open-label study to assess feasibility of implementing an individualized treatment regimen in patients with surgical recurrent GBM. Patients are not stratified according to demographic or treatment-related parameters. Patients must have recurrent glioblastoma treated with appropriate tumor treatment including radiation therapy at initial diagnosis. Surgery must be clinically indicated and patients must be candidates for tumor resection at UCSF.  The goal of the current study is to build upon prior results by confirming the feasibility of actually implementing patient-specific drug regimens in a rapid, clinically-relevant timetable. We will also assess for efficacy, safety, and response outcomes of these patient-specific regimens, to generate preliminary data that would support a larger trial assessing efficacy of such an approach.  Resected tumor tissue and blood will be examined using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) UCSF 500 Cancer Gene Panel at the UCSF Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory and Whole genome and RNA sequencing. The clinical report generated from the NGS UCSF 500 panel will be provided to a study-specific Tumor Board who will generate an individualized treatment recommendation based on the report. The individualized treatment regimen potentially will include up to 4 repurposed off-the-shelf FDA-approved targeted agents. The Board will identify the expected/anticipated drug-drug interactions and anticipated additional toxicities of the combination of therapies. The treating physician is given the report, discusses the suggested treatment options with the patient, and initiates treatment, ideally within 28 calendar days (and no later than 35 calendar days) after surgery. Treatment will continue until tumor progression."

32,Mathematical Model-Adapted Radiation In Glioblastoma,NCT03557372,"This research study is a Feasibility Study, which means that this is the first time that investigators are examining this new radiation schedule for recurrent glioblastoma.  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved radiation therapy as a treatment option for your disease. This is the first time that this particular radiation schedule will be tested in humans. There many other studies which have tested different radiation schedules in glioblastoma.  In this research study, investigators are adapting a standard two-week schedule of radiation commonly used for recurrent glioblastoma using a mathematical model. This study uses the same total dose of radiation as standard treatments but breaks up the dose into different amounts daily to maximize tumor kill. investigators have used a new mathematical model to create this schedule of radiation. This model was created to better represent how glioblastoma cells can escape the damaging effects of radiation. Based on the results of several laboratory studies, it is possible that this model may result in improved outcomes compared to standard radiation schedules.  The primary question of this study is to see whether participants can complete this new radiation schedule at the scheduled times. In addition, investigators will follow participants to ensure that this treatment is safe. If this treatment proves feasible, investigators hope to compare this treatment directly with standard radiation schedules for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma."

39,Sulfasalazine and Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT04205357,Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and most common type of primary brain cancer. Standard treatment at diagnosis is surgery followed by high dose radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Despite initial treatment nearly all patients will experience recurrence of the tumor with a dismal prognosis. There is no consensus on standard of care at recurrence. Reoperation is associated with a high risk of complications and further conventional radiation therapy is often not possible as the maximum tolerated dose to the normal brain has already been given. In addition most tumors have developed resistance towards chemotherapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be administered despite prior initial radiation treatment but in order to avoid radiation induced complications only limited doses to limited tumor volumes can be applied.  Developing new strategies to improve the effect of radiation selectively on tumor cells without simultaneously increase the radiation induced damage of normal brain would be valuable.  The investigators have shown in experimental studies that the drug sulfasalazine enhances the number of cancer cells that dies as result of radiation therapy and thereby improves survival in combination with SRS in animals with glioblastoma. Sulfasalazine inhibits the production of an antioxidant that normally protects the tumor against radiation. Hopefully the trial will result in a new and more effective treatment option for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
40,Phase II Study of Combined Temozolomide and SGT-53 for Treatment of Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02340156,"The p53 is a vital human tumor suppressor gene. Loss of p53 suppressor function is present in the majority of human cancers. The p53 protein has a diverse range of functions including regulation of cell cycle checkpoints, cell death (apoptosis), senescence, DNA repair, maintenance of genomic integrity, and control of angiogenesis. Abnormalities of the p53 gene may impact the efficacy of standard anticancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. P53 mutation and pathway dysfunction are associated with poor clinical outcomes and the presence of the p53 mutation correlates with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. The development of somatic gene therapy has created the potential to restore wild type function of p53. SGT-53 is a complex of cationic liposome encapsulating a normal human wild type p53 DNA sequence in a plasmid backbone. This complex has been shown to efficiently and specifically deliver the p53 cDNA to the tumor cells and to cross the blood-brain barrier. Introduction of the p53 cDNA sequence is expected to restore wtp53 function in the apoptotic pathway. P53 restoration has been shown most effective in enhancing cytotoxicity in combination with an agent which results in DNA damage or initiates apoptosis. The primary mechanism of resistance to current standard chemotherapeutic agent Temozolomide (TMZ) is overexpression of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyl transferase (MGMT), which repairs the TMZ-induced DNA lesion by removing the o6-guanine adducts. Thus, a means to down modulate MGMT activity would enhance the therapeutic effect of TMZ. A number of reports have indicated that increasing wtp53 expression can down-regulate expression of DNA repair genes such as MGMT and increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to alkylating agents. This is a Phase II clinical trial of the tumor-targeted SGT-53 nanocomplex in combination with chemotherapeutic agent, temozolomide which is the standard of care for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) brain tumors. We propose to test the combination of SGT-53 and standard temozolomide to determine efficacy and safety in patients with confirmed glioblastoma who have proven tumor recurrence or progression."

Bevacizumab has been approved by the Food and Drug administration for treating brain tumors that grow back. In this study, patients will either get HSPPC-96 vaccine at the same time as bevacizumab, HSPPC vaccine first and then bevacizumab if the tumor comes back, or bevacizumab alone. The use of HSPPC-96 and bevacizumab is investigational.  The primary objective of the study is to determine whether there is an overall survival advantage of HSPPC-96 administered with bevacizumab, given concomitantly or at the point of progression, in comparison with bevacizumab alone in patients with surgically resectable recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.  The secondary objectives are:  to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HSPPC-96 with bevacizumab to evaluate the progression free survival of HSPPC-96 with bevacizumab, given concomitantly or at the point of progression.  Patients must undergo surgery within 28 days from pre-registration. There must be confirmation of adequacy of tissue for vaccine manufacture, tumor tissue submitted to Agenus, confirmation of ¡Ã 90% resection by central radiology review and vaccine manufacture of at least six vials. Patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms. Please see the ""Arms"" section for more details.  Patients will be monitored approximately 5 years post-surgery."

51,Laparoscopically Harvested Omental Free Tissue Autograft to Bypass the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) in Human Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (rGBM),NCT04222309,"Laparoscopically harvested omental free flaps are commonly used to fill surgical cavities after resection of head and neck cancers. The investigators hypothesize that a laparoscopically harvested omental free flap in our patients with resected recurrent GBM may be used as a readily available and accessible means of circumventing the blood brain barrier (BBB) selectively and focally. The laparoscopically harvested omental free flap with its long vascular pedicle length, wide rotational arc and available surface area would easily conform to many resected GBM cavities in our human patients with acceptable risk. The predictable and rich vascular anatomy of a laparoscopically harvested omental free makes it an ideal flap for cases of previously irradiated and/or infected wound beds. This is why it is successfully used in head and neck and skull base tumors. The permeability of the blood vessels of the laparoscopically harvested omental free flap should allow for improved delivery of chemotherapeutics and immune cells (macrophages and T cells) into the vicinity, extracellular space and microenvironment of the resected tumor cavity including the brain adjacent to the tumor (BAT). ""Milky spots"" within the omentum will also provide direct deposition of immune cells such as dendritic, macrophages and lymphocytes into the milieu of the resected GBM.  The investigators aim to prove that this commonly surgical technique for head and neck cancers is safe in a small human cohort of patients with resected recurrent GBM and may improve progression-free survival (PFS)."
52,Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02337686,"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:  I. To evaluate immune effector function in resected glioblastoma tissue after treatment with intravenously administered pembrolizumab monotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.  II. To correlate the progression free survival at 6 months (PFS6) with objective increases in the immune effector T cell: regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio in tumor tissue as measured by ex vivo T-cell-specific cytokines profiling.  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:  I. Comparison of time to progression of last prior therapy to time to progression on pembrolizumab, median duration of response, overall response rate (ORR), and overall survival (OS) and safety.  TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:  I. To identify imaging characteristics associated with immunological changes in tumor following treatment with pembrolizumab.  OUTLINE:  Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -21 and day -1, and then undergo surgery on day 0. After 2-3 weeks or recovery from surgery, patients continue to receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 42 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months."
53,Neuradiab? Combined With Bevacizumab (Avastin) Therapy in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT00906516,"At present there are no satisfactory therapies for these patients with recurrent GBM and the practitioner is left with best effort combination therapy for this disease. At present a number of chemotherapeutic agents, including nitrosoureas, carboplatin, bevacizumab, etoposide, irinotecan, and imatinib, have been used as salvage therapy either alone or in combination. Additional trials with a variety of agents are underway, but preliminary results from single-agent studies have been disappointing. Currently, only nitrosoureas (lomustine and carmustine), including Gliadel? Wafer (carmustine) as adjunct to surgery, are approved for use in previously treated GBM. At present the treatment of recurrent disease with any available agent results in median survival in the ranges of 22-44 weeks. The historical data from previous human exposure with Neuradiab is highly suggestive of a benefit to patient survival.  Since Neuradiab? has shown promising efficacy in patients with recurrent disease with acceptable risk-benefit ratio, and since there is no substantial survival benefit from currently available agents used to treat this patient population, Neuradiab? is being proposed as an experimental alternative to recurrent GBM patients under a Single-Center Phase II Trial. Recurrent GBM is a serious and immediately life-threatening disease, for which there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative drug or other therapy available to treat that stage of the disease. Overall, survival data indicate a need for more effective treatments for recurrent GBM."
54,Adjuvant Stereotactic Fractionated Radiotherapy to the Resection Cavity in Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02715297,"The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma is, beside of its abundance in clinical practice, still under discussion. Patients presenting with recurrent disease are therefore treated within individual concepts, largely based on small prospective trials, retrospective evaluations or case reports. Therefore, the treatment ranges from best supportive care over primary systemic treatments towards local therapies such as radiotherapy or surgical resection. Even if there might be a large selection bias, local therapies with or without concomitant or adjuvant chemotherapy seem to promise the largest prognostic benefit. Whether the combination of surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy improves survival, as it does within the primary situation, is unknown.  The result of surgical resection might have an impact as well. Several case reports, retrospective evaluations and prospective studies have also included patients with remaining gross tumor after maximum save resection. In these trials, radiotherapy was associated with improvements in progression free as well as overall survival. Therefore, the influence of neuroimaging on prognosis is currently evaluated within the GLIA-A trial. Furthermore, stereotactic radiotherapy with or without an experimental systemic therapy is currently investigated within another multicenter randomized trial (NOA-12).  Whether patients might benefit from a postoperative radiotherapy of the resection cavity after complete extirpation of all macroscopic tumor is key question of this protocol.  To answer this question, the considered standard of care after complete resection, namely observation with or without adjuvant systemic therapy, will be compared to a postoperative normofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy towards the resection cavity within an open label, randomized trial. The prescribed total dose will be 46 Gy in 2 Gy fractions of 36 Gy in 3 Gy fractions depending on the treatment volume.  Concerning safety, side effects will be monitored prospectively. Safety parameters will be compared between both arms of the study. Furthermore, measures for quality of life, neurocognitive function as well as neuroimaging features will be evaluated prospectively."
55,Phase 1/2a Study of BAL101553 as 48-hour Infusions in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02895360,"This is the first study of prolonged intravenous infusion of BAL101553. BAL101553 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 48 hours, to adults with advanced or recurrent solid tumors or recurrent glioblastoma who have failed standard therapy, or for whom no effective standard therapy is available.  The primary goal of the study is to find the highest dose of BAL101553 that can safely be given to humans and to assess what side effects occur. The study will start by treating patients with a low dose. Once it has been shown that this low dose is well tolerated, new patients will be treated at higher dose levels (""dose escalation""). Once the highest, well tolerated dose is identified, 20 new patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer and 20 new patients with recurrent glioblastoma will be treated at that dose (this part is called ""dose expansion"") to further assess the tolerability and potential anticancer activity of oral BAL101553. The study will also measure pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects and assess biomarkers."
56,Multimodal Imaging Analysis During Treatment With Bevacizumab in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02841332,"Glioblastomas are tumors with poor prognosis. The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma after a standard first-line treatment is not clearly codified, however, many results in the literature show the benefit of bevacizumab (anti- angiogenic therapy) and it is often proposed in this indication . Tissue action, response mechanisms and therapeutic escape remain is poorly understood.  The investigators hypothesize that these response mechanisms are controlled by changes in some parameters in the tumor tissue, such as hypoxia, neoangiogenesis, cell density and that multimodal imaging can help us to better understand these mechanisms.  To identify which parameters of imaging would best measure response mechanisms, the investigators want to evaluate in the first study and for this particular indication , a property of the measure called by the Anglo -Saxon ' sensitivity to change "" that is to say, its sensitivity or ability to measure changes. This is an additional property to the reproducibility of the measurement."
57,"Phase I Study of Monoclonal Antibondy (GS) 5745, an Matix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) Mab Inhibitor, in Combination With Bevacizumab in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma",NCT03631836,"Despite surgery and first-line standard of care which consist of radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide, all patients with glioblastoma (GB) will experience relapse. At the time of recurrence, therapeutic options include surgery or reirradiation in selected cases, while in other cases, bevacizumab, approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but not European Medicines Agency (EMA), is the preferred option worldwide. Primary and acquired resistance to bevacizumab has been explored without definitive finding.  Biomarkers able to predict response to antiangiogenic agents and particularly to bevacizumab are an unmet medical need. We have showed that a low Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) or a high Matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) baseline plasma levels were associated with a high response rate and a prolonged Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in recurrent GB patients treated with bevacizumab but not with cytotoxic chemotherapy. We also observed that MMP9 plasma level decreased during bevacizumab treatment and tend to increase at progression. Finally, in a retrospective analysis performed in the Avaglio trial (a randomized phase III trial that tested bevacizumab versus placebo in addition to standard of care in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma), a low plasma level of MMP9 at baseline predicted consistently PFS and OS gain associated to bevacizumab.  These results are consistent with the role of MMP9 in vasculogenesis, since MMP9 contribute to the recruitment of circulating endothelial and myeloid precursors, an alternative vascularization process which is in part independent of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway.  Monoclonal Antibody (GS) 5745 is specifically directed against MMP9. First in human phase I study has been completed. Development is ongoing.  Our results strongly support a role for MMP9 in the primary or acquired resistance to bevacizumab. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Monoclonal Antibody GS5745 may overcome resistance to bevacizumab through a specific inhibition of MMP9. While a preclinical program is initiated in our lab, the proposed phase I study is the first step to analyze the tolerance, determine the recommended dose of the combination and explore the impact of GS5745 on MMP9 plasma levels and multimodal imaging in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.  Objective:  Determine the safety profile and tolerability of GS5745 given in combination with a fixed dose of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent GB in terms of Dose-Limiting Toxicities.  Multicenter, open label, dose-finding study of GS5745 in combination with bevacizumab administered at a fixed dose; both drugs will be administered once every two weeks for a total treatment duration of a maximum of 12 months.  Before initiation of each new dose level, a meeting between the sponsor, the coordinator, the investigators and an independent external expert will take place to decide jointly the next dose."
58,Phase I/II Adaptive Randomized Trial of Bevacizumab Versus Bevacizumab Plus Vorinostat in Adults With Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT01266031,"Background  Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. With optimal treatment, consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, median survival is 14.6 months. Most patients have evidence of tumor progression within one year of diagnosis despite treatment. At progression, treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective. Given the importance of angiogenesis in GBM, anti-angiogenic therapy is a promising strategy in recurrent GBM. Bevacizumab, the first angiogenesis inhibitor approved against cancer by FDA based on improved survival of advanced colon cancer patient, has recently been studied in the GBM. The present study aims to determine the potential of vorinostat, an HDAC inhibitor plus bevacizumab, versus bevacizumab alone, in an attempt to increase the anti-angiogenic effects of VEGF by blocking the evasive resistance by combination with vorinostat and to also not only provide the potential of the independent effects of both agents but also the potential for synergy.  Objectives  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat plus bevacizumab in adult patients with malignant glioma. To determine the efficacy of vorinostat plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV glioma (glioblastoma and gliosarcoma) as determined by progression free survival (PFS) using an adaptive randomization phase II trial design.  Eligibility  Patients must have histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma or anaplastic glioma to be eligible for the Phase I component of this protocol. Anaplastic gliomas include anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant glioma NOS (not otherwise specified). Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a malignant glioma is made. Only patients with histologically proven or imaging proven recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be eligible for the Phase II component. Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression as determined by an MRI scan done prior to study entry which will be reviewed by the treating physician to confirm and document recurrence. No prior treatment with bevacizumab or Vorinostat  Design  The phase I component will assess the MTD of Vorinostat in combination with Bevacizumab. A conventional phase I design will be used and the MTD will be selected using a 3+3 accrual design at each dose level until MTD is determined. A maximum of 18 patients will be recruited to this component of the study.  The phase II component of the trial compares Bevacizumab to Vorinostat+ Bevacizumab in patients with recurrent GBM. The primary outcome is progression free survival. Patients will be randomized between the two arms using a Bayesian adaptive algorithm. Patients will be randomized fairly between the two arms at the start of the trial (for the first 20 patients). Thereafter, as the trial progresses and data accrue, the randomization will become unbalanced in favor of the treatment that, on average, has better results in terms of failure time. Therefore, each successive patient is more likely to receive the treatment with better results, on average. A minimum of 20 and a maximum of 90 patients will be accrued."

67,Dose Escalation Trial of Re-irradiation in Good Prognosis Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02709226,"Background  Although the survival of gliomas has improved, most high grade gliomas will recur in field or adjacent to the treatment field within months to years of the original treatment. In newly diagnosed GBM, the concurrent use of radiation and temozolomide is standard of care. Surgical resection upon recurrence is possible in less than 50% of patients. For a significant proportion of recurrent glioma patients in whom reresection is not favourable and for whom systemic options have been exhausted, re-irradiation has emerged as a possible treatment option. Using modern precision RT techniques (stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), Rapid Arc techniques), re-irradiation has proven a feasible option with possible benefit in outcome as these techniques are often able to minimize dose to previously treated organs at risk in the field (OAR) and treat the recurrence safely. Data from multiple retrospective studies has indicated that not only is re-irradiation feasible, but it may actually improve survival in the appropriately selected patient.  Objective  The primary objective of this phase I study is to determine maximum tolerated re-irradiation dose (MTD).  Eligibility  Recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma Prior standard radiation therapy to a dose ranging from 50 to 60 Gy at 1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction. Prior irradiation > 12 months from enrollment on protocol. Age greater than or equal to 18. KPS greater than or equal to 70  Design  Radiation therapy will be administered daily Monday-Friday at Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB), NCI. All the protocol related follow-up appointments will occur at NCI ROB. Radiation therapy dose will be administered on consecutive treatment days, 5 fractions per week via a linear accelerator using 6 MV photons or greater. Using a 3 plus 3 design , and three dose escalation levels, with 6 patients per dose level with 9 total patients at the MTD (provided no DLT), a maximum of 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled. Time to progression will be determined by the interval from initiation of treatment on protocol to progression as per RANO criteria. Neurologic decline without radiographic evidence of tumor will be designated as treatment related toxicity. Survival duration will be determined by the interval from initiation of treatment on protocol to date of death."

69,"Phase I / II Vorinostat, Erlotinib and Temozolomide for Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)",NCT01110876,"Phase I:  The Study Drugs:  Vorinostat is designed to cause chemical changes in different groups of proteins that are attached to DNA (the genetic material of cells), which may slow the growth of cancer cells or cause the cancer cells to die.  Erlotinib is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface of many tumor cells that may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop tumors from growing.  Temozolomide is designed to kill cancer cells by damaging DNA (the genetic material of cells). The damaged DNA may cause tumor cell death.  Study Groups:  There are 2 phases to this study.  If you are found to be eligible to take part in the Phase I portion of this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on when you join this study. You will remain in the same group for the entire study. In this study, the dose level of the study drugs is different from group to group. Up to 4 dose levels of study drug combinations will be tested in Group 1, up to 2 dose levels in Group 2. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first 3 participants in each group will receive the lowest dose level. Each 3 new participants will receive a higher dose than the one before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of study drugs given in combination is found.  If you are in Group 1, you will take vorinostat, erlotinib, and temozolomide. If you are in Group 2, you will take vorinostat and erlotinib.  In addition, no matter which group or dose level you are assigned to, if you are on enzyme inducing anti-seizure drug, you will take a higher dose of erlotinib.  Study Drug Administration:  Each study cycle is 28 days.  If you are in Group 1:  On Days 1-7 and 15-21 of every cycle, you will take vorinostat by mouth 2 times a day. You should take vorinostat with food. Do not open, crush, or chew the capsules. On Days 1-21 of every cycle, you will take erlotinib by mouth 1 time a day. You should take erlotinib in the morning 1 hour before or 2 hours after food with 1 cup (about 8 oz.) of water. On Days 1-7 and 15-21of every cycle, you will take the temozolomide by mouth 1 time a day. You should swallow the temozolomide capsules whole, one right after the other, without chewing them. If you vomit while taking temozolomide, you cannot take more capsules before the next scheduled dose. They should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after eating) with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water.  If you are in Group 2:  On Days 1-14 of every cycle, you will take vorinostat by mouth 2 times a day. You should take vorinostat with food. Do not open, crush, or chew the capsules. On Days 1-21 of every cycle, you will take erlotinib by mouth 1 time a day. You should take erlotinib in the morning 1 hour before or 2 hours after food with 1 cup (about 8 oz.) of water.  Study Visits:  Every 4 weeks for the first 8 weeks, then every 8 weeks after that:  Your complete medical history will be recorded. You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side effects. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. You will have a neurological exam. Your performance status will be recorded.  Every week for the first 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks after that, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood's ability to clot normally.  Every 4 weeks, if you are on anti-seizure drugs, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure the amount of anti-seizure drugs in your blood.  Every 8 weeks, you will have an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.  Length of Study:  You will be on study for up to 1 year. You may continue to receive the study drugs beyond 1 year and remain on study if your doctor decides that it is in your best interest. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.  Long-Term Follow-Up Visit:  If you go off study after 12 cycles, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood's ability to clot normally every 2 weeks during the 30 days after your last dose of study drugs.  If you go off the study for reasons other than the worsening of the disease, you will have an MRI every 2 months unless the disease gets worse.  If you have an MRI that shows worsening of the disease, every 2-3 months from then on, you may be called and asked how you are feeling and about any new cancer treatment that you may have received. This phone call should take about 5-10 minutes.  This is an investigational study. Erlotinib is FDA approved drug for treatment of some types of non-small cell lung cancer, temozolomide for some types of brain cancer, and vorinostat for some types of lymphoma. All are commercially available. The use of these drugs in this combination is investigational.  Up to 182 participants will take part in this study. Up to 72 patients will be enroll in the Phase 1 portion of this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

Subset Group:  If your doctor has recommended that you have surgery to remove a tumor that has come back, you will be eligible for this subset group. You would have the surgery before being assigned to a main study group. This subset group of the study is done to learn the effects of vorinostat on tumor tissue and blood cells.  Before surgery, you will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups.  If you are in Group A, you will receive vorinostat alone. If you are in Group B, you will receive erlotinib alone. If you are in Group C, you will receive both vorinostat and erlotinib.  You will take the study drug(s) for 3 days in a row before your surgery.  About 2 weeks after the surgery, you will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 main study groups described above (Group 1 or 2).  In addition, no matter which group you are assigned to, if you are on enzyme inducing anti-seizure drug, you will take the higher dose of erlotinib.  Study Drug Administration:  Every cycle is 28 days.  If you are in Group 1:  On Days 1-14 of every cycle, you will take vorinostat by mouth 2 times a day. You should take vorinostat with food. Do not open, crush, or chew the capsules. On Days 1-21 of every cycle, you will take erlotinib by mouth 1 time a day. You should take erlotinib in the morning 1 hour before or 2 hours after food with 1 cup (about 8 oz.) of water.  If you are in Group 2:  On Days 1-7 and 15-21 of every cycle, you will take vorinostat by mouth 2 times a day .You should take vorinostat with food. Do not open, crush, or chew the capsules. On Days 1-21 of every cycle, you will take erlotinib by mouth 1 time a day . You should take erlotinib in the morning 1 hour before or 2 hours after food with 1 cup (about 8 oz.) of water. On Days 1-7 and 15-21 of every cycle, you will take the temozolomide by mouth 1 time a day. You should swallow the temozolomide capsules whole, one right after the other, without chewing them. If you vomit while taking temozolomide, you cannot take more capsules before the next scheduled dose. They should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after eating) with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water.  Subset group:  For 3 days in row before surgery:  If you are in Group A, you will take vorinostat by mouth 2 times a day. If you are in Group B, you will take erlotinib by mouth 1 time a day. If you are in Group C, you will take vorinostat by mouth 2 time a day and erlotinib by mouth 1 time a day.  After you have recovered from the effects of surgery (about 2 weeks), you will follow the study group schedule (Group 1 or 2) described above.  Study Visits:  Every 4 weeks for the first 8 weeks, then every 8 weeks after that:  Your complete medical history will be recorded. You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have had any side effects. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. You will have a neurological exam. Your performance status will be recorded.  Every week for the first 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks after that, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood's ability to clot normally.  Every 4 weeks, if you are on anti-seizure medications, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure the amount of anti-seizure medications in your blood.  Every 8 weeks, you will have an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.  Subset Group:  In addition to the above tests, blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn 1 time before and 3 times after the first dose of vorinostat, and during surgery. This blood will be used to study the drug levels, the effects of the drug in normal blood cells, and to match these findings with that in the tumor.  After the surgery, part of the leftover tumor tissue from the surgery will be used to measure the drug levels and the effects of vorinostat on the tumor and be used for biomarker tests.  Length of Study:  You will be on study for up to 1 year. You may continue to receive treatment beyond 1 year and remain on study if your doctor decides that it is in your best interest. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or you have intolerable side effects.  Long-Term Follow-Up Visit:  If you go off study after 12 cycles, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood's ability to clot normally every 2 weeks during the 30 days after your last dose of study drugs.  If you go off the study for reasons other than the worsening of the disease, you will have an MRI every 2 months unless the disease gets worse.  If you have an MRI that shows worsening of the disease, every 2-3 months from then on, you may be called and asked how you are feeling and about any new cancer treatment that you may have received. This phone call will take about 5-10 minutes.  This is an investigational study. Erlotinib is FDA approved drug for treatment of some types of non-small cell lung cancer, temozolomide for some types of brain cancer, and vorinostat for some types of lymphoma. All are commercially available. The use of these drugs in this combination is investigational.  Up to 182 participants will take part in this study. Up to 110 patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of this study. Up to 15 participants will take part in the subset portion of the study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

72,Early-Phase Study to Assess Inhibitor Ribociclib in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma or Anaplastic Glioma,NCT02345824,"Preliminary evaluation of efficacy and determination of the ribociclib safety profile in patients with brain tumors will be studied. All patients will be treated with ribociclib (600 mg/day) for 8-21 days before surgical resection of the recurrent tumor. Rb status of the recurrent tumor will be determined by immunohistochemistry within 2 weeks after surgery. Patients with Rb-positive tumors will continue treatment with ribociclib (21 days on, 7 days off) after surgery. Patients will be treated until unacceptable toxicity is observed, or until disease progression as assessed by radiographic or clinical metrics. We will determine whether molecular markers associated with changes induced by ribociclib treatment in tumors (matching initial vs. recurrent tumors) correlate with progression-free survival.  Approximately 20% of patients with recurrent high-grade glioma will undergo surgical resection of their tumor typically at the time of first recurrence. These patients will be eligible for this study. An extra 10 mL of blood will be collected during a routine clinical procedure prior to initiation of ribociclib treatment (i.e., baseline blood sample), separated into plasma and buffy coat fractions, and frozen for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis. Patients will be treated with ribociclib for 8-21 days prior to surgery to identify drug effects on tumor cells, and to determine drug PK. The last presurgical dose of ribociclib will be administered on the day of surgery at 4-8 hours prior to surgery to allow sufficient time for the drug to enter tumor cells, inhibit CDK4/6, and modulate downstream effectors. Blood will be acquired within 1 hour before surgery (as close to the time of surgery as possible). Blood will be separated into plasma and buffy coat fractions, and frozen. During surgery, samples of brain tumor core and infiltrating brain tumor will be acquired. Tissue samples will be frozen or fixed in paraffin embedded blocks and histology for PK and molecular analyses."

79,Intra-tumoral Ipilimumab Plus Intravenous Nivolumab Following the Resection of Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT03233152,"Nivolumab (OpdivoTM, BMS), a human IgG-4 mAb that blocks the Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, CD279) has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in patients with various solid- and hematological neoplasms. Nivolumab has been registered by EMA and/or FDA for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and Hodgkin lymphoma. In a phase I dose escalation clinical trial, receptor blockade of PD-1 by nivolumab on circulating lymphocytes was maximal at a dose of 0,3 mg/kg. In patients with advanced melanoma nivolumab had a comparable tumor response rate at a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg q2wks. Nivolumab was further developed at a dose of 3 mg/kg q2wks and improved the overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma, NSCL, RCC and HNSCC.  Ipilimumab (YervoyTM, BMS), a human IgG-1 anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody improves the overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma; and the relapse-free survival after complete resection of high-risk stage III melanoma. Animal models have established the safety and efficacy of intra-tumoral administration of ipilimumab. An intratumoral dose of CTLA-4 blocking mAb administered at a ratio of [1:100] compared to intravenous dosing was found to result in equivalent anti-tumor effect and was associated with less systemic toxicity.  Combined treatment with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg q3wks x4) plus nivolumab (1 mg/kg q3 wks x4 followed by 3 mg/kg q2 wks) further increases the tumor response rate and progression-free survival of patients with advanced melanoma and has been registered by EMA and FDA; this combination therapy is associated with a higher incidence of immune related adverse events. Nivolumab and ipilimumab have distinct immunological mechanisms that can be revealed by analyzing TCR usage in blood lymphocytes.  Preliminary safety and activity of nivolumab and its combination with ipilimumab in recurrent glioblastoma (CHECKMATE-143) were presented at the 2015 and 2016 ASCO Annual meetings (20 pts were treated, 10 in each arm). [15] All nivolumab related AEs were grade 1 or 2. Eight (80%) nivolumab plus ipilimumab treated patients experienced grade 3/4 AEs. Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation occurred only in nivolumab plus ipilimumab patients (n = 5; 50%), including colitis, cholecystitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, confusion, and increased lipase. There were no drug-related deaths. Based on these experiences, the sponsor (BMS) decided to further investigate nivolumab as a mono-therapy in patients with recurrent- and newly diagnosed glioblastoma (CA209-143; CA209-498 and CA209-548). Antitumor activity of nivolumab has recently been established in children with recurrent glioblastoma that is characterized by biallelic mismatch repair deficiency."

82,A Study of Abemaciclib in Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02981940,"This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is being studied.  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved abemaciclib as a treatment for any disease.  Many brain cancers show over expression of a protein called cyclin D1. That means that the body makes too much cyclin D1, which affects enzymes called CDK 4 and CDK 6. Enzymes are substances in the body that help reactions between cells happen. Too much cyclin D1 triggers CDK 4 and CDK 6 to make more cells than normal. This extra cell production leads to the growth of tumors.  In laboratory studies, Abemaciclib was able to enter the brain, stop CDK 4 and CDK 6 from making cells, and slow growth of mice Glioblastoma.  In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how safe and effect Abemaciclib is with the participant type of cancer. In the surgical participants, the investigators are looking to see if Abemaciclib reached the brain tumor."

Tumors that are deficient in the homologous recombination DNA damage repair pathway are highly sensitive to blockade of the repair of single strand DNA breaks via poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition. This is a study of niraparib, a PARP inhibitor, in combination with tumor-treating fields for recurrent glioblastoma. We hypothesize that tumor-treating fields will induce a state of ""BRCAness"" in the glioma tumor cells, thus sensitizing them to PARP inhibition and resulting in tumor cell death."
87,Bortezomib and Temozolomide in Recurrent Glioblastoma With Unmethylated MGMT Promoter (BORTEM-17),NCT03643549,"Patients harbouring tumours with functional O6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) DNA repair enzyme efficiently repair the DNA damage inflicted by Temozolomide and gain limited benefit from this chemotherapy. Bortezomib depletes the MGMT enzyme, restoring the tumour¢¥s susceptibility to Temozolomide, if the chemotherapy is administered in the precise schedule when the MGMT enzyme is depleted. Additionally, Bortezomib inhibits the growth of tumour cells by blocking autophagy flux. Temozolomide causes genotoxic stress in cancer cells that in turn respond by inducing protective processes such as autophagy. If both autophagy and MGMT DNA repair enzyme are blocked a priori, the efficacy of Temozolomide will be enhanced. Thus, pre-treating the tumour with Bortezomib prior to administration of Temozolomide leads to DNA repair enzyme depletion and blockade of autophagy-induced survival signals. The combined effect will sensitize the tumour to therapy, improve chemotherapy efficacy and prolong patient survival outcomes.  Hypothesis: Pretreatment with Bortezomib administered prior to Temozolomide will sensitize recurrent GBM with unmethylated MGMT promoter to standard TMZ in palliative setting.  Objective:  Assessment of safety and tolerability of Bortezomib administered with Temozolomide. Determining the optimal dose of TMZ, when administered as combination therapy Estimate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent or progressed glioblastoma after pre-treatment with Bortezomib prior to combination with Temozolomide.

Clinical data generated with Nivolumab monotherapy in a variety of settings support the hypothesis that blockade of the PD-1 pathway results in rejection of tumor by the host immune system. The precise mechanisms by which Nivolumab exerts its anti-tumor activity are still under investigation. To contribute to this knowledge, tumor tissue from primary operation for all patients and tumor tissue from patients in the surgical Arm A will be used for further analysis.  Targeted sequencing with next generation sequencing (NGS) and Genome-wide Associations Studies (GWAS) with the use of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-arrays and micro-array for expression profiling will be performed in order to describe the profile of the tumor. At Rigshospitalet has initiated a program of NGS of patients with GBM after informed content, by obtaining fresh tissue from primary or relapse surgery. In the surgical group (Arm A) of this study NGS will be repeated after one dose of Nivolumab. This information will be used in combination with the clinical observations for each patient receiving the combination of Nivolumab and Bevacizumab and the aim is that these results could be useful towards finding prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers in GBM.  In order to study the interaction between tumor cells and the immune system investigation of intratumoral and peripheral changes in tumor-infiltration lymphocytes (TILs) will be performed. By looking at TILs and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) Surgical samples will be compared to sequencing of baseline surgical samples (before Nivolumab). The interaction of TILs and tumor cells will be assessed with in vitro functional assays of autologous tumor cell recognition. Functional patterns of antitumor CD8+ and CD4+ TILs and PBLs will be investigated, with assays combining characterization of major T cell functions and simultaneous surface staining of PD-1 after co-culture with autologous tumor cells. This may detect treatment-induced changes in the functional repertoires of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs both in the tumor microenvironment (TILs) and in the periphery (PBLs). It is expected that these analyses will reveal whether significant functional changes (defined as increased frequency of tumor-reactive T cells or as functional shifting from a monofunctional to a multifunctional profile) are induced in the whole repertoire of T cells, or whether these changes are restricted to PD-1 positive T cells.  Regarding the immune-reactivity, CD8 T cell recognition of tumor-specific-antigens (TSA), i.e. and mutation derived neoepitopes will be analyzed in enrolled patients. To analyze for immune reactivity on a personalized basis by comprising epitope-maps based on both mutation-derived neoepitopes and shared tumor antigens selected based on the individual tumor mRNA expression level.  For the prediction of mutation- and splice-variation derived epitopes, whole exome sequencing (WES) and mRNA sequencing will be conducted on tumor versus germline-control samples. Cancer-specific mutations, indels, frameshifts and splice variations will be mapped to predict T cell epitopes overlapping these regions based on the patient HLA type, using available prediction tools, netMHC. A pipeline for processing next-generation sequencing data into tumor-specific neo-epitope maps has been generated to include analyses of tumor heterogeneity and generate personalized peptide libraries for each patient and analyze for T cell recognition of personalized neoepitopes in each patient included in the study. A novel technology will tag and track multiple (>1000) antigen specific T cell specificities based on their peptide-MHC (pMHC) recognition motif through a pMHC multimer with a co-attached 'DNA barcode'. Through use of this technology T cell recognition will be assessed against large libraries of peptides in limited biological samples, such as tissue biopsies, TILs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Data will reveal to what extend mutation and splice-variant derived neoepitopes are contributing to immune recognition as a consequence of checkpoint inhibition. If these are significantly recognized, then they are likely to play a crucial role for the clinical response to checkpoint inhibition."

III. Analyze volumetric data consisting of thermal damage threshold lines and overall tumor volume to determine any role of 'extent of ablation' in outcomes (OS and/or TTP).  IV. Characterize the safety profile of LITT followed by treatment with lomustine chemotherapy in the recurrent disease setting, using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  V. Assess the long-term steroid requirements following LITT, compared to historical controls.  VI. Determine the radiographic evolution of LITT-treated glioblastoma over time, using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T1 pre and post-contrast images, T2-weighted images [T2WI], fluid attenuating inversion recovery [FLAIR] images) and advanced brain tumor imaging (ABTI) [magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion [dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) and arterial spin labeling (ASL)], MR-diffusion, and MR spectroscopy), to include quantitative tumor metrics (volumetric extent of ablation and Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology [RANO] criteria).  VII. Analyze health care utilization as measured by length of hospital stay following LITT (including inpatient rehabilitation care).  VIII. Evaluate patients' functional status (using the Karnofsky performance score [KPS] and the occurrence of symptoms [using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT[English])] self-reporting tool), and correlate to disease progression and tolerance to treatment.  EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:  I. Identify correlative tumor and peripheral blood molecular markers that impact outcomes, etc, and identify inflammatory/immunologic markers to assess neoantigen expression, etc, if sufficient tissue is available.  II. Identify and characterize changes in tumor tissue following LITT, by analyzing and comparing pre- and post-procedure tissue samples, if sufficient tissue is available.

97,Amino-acid PET Versus MRI Guided Re-irradiation in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT01252459,"The higher sensitivity and specificity of amino-acids (L-[methyl-11C]-methionine, MET and O-(2-(1)-Fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine, FET) positron emission tomography (AA-PET) in the diagnosis of gliomas in comparison to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was demonstrated in many studies and is the rationale for using them in target volume delineation of these tumors. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the significant differences between AA-PET and standard MRI in gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation for treatment planning.  A small prospective study in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas treated with stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT) showed a significant improvement in survival when AA-PET or single photon emission tomography (AA-SPECT) were integrated in target volume delineation, in comparison to patients treated using CT/MRI alone (Grosu et al. 2005).  However, there are no randomized studies demonstrating the impact of AA-PET based irradiation treatment on the clinical follow-up in comparison to a traditional MRI/CT based treatment.  The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of radiotherapy target volume delineation based on AA-PET (new strategy) on the clinical outcome of patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) compared to target volume delineation based on contrast enhanced T1 weighted MRI (T1Gd-MRI) (traditional, established strategy). Concerning therapeutic safety, the topography of recurrence outside the primary target volume as well as the localization of necrosis after the re-irradiation will be determined. All side effects will be assessed by CTCAE version 4.0 and the safety analyses will present the worst grade of acute and late side effect by treatment arm for the whole study period (treatment and follow up). Patients will be asked to complete a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire (as assessed by the E-ORTC QLQ-C15 PAL) in regular time intervals.  This will be the first phase II randomized study evaluating the impact of molecular imaging on outcome after radiotherapy in brain tumor patients.  Another goal of the technical part of this study is the development of a standardized physical-technical methodology for the integration of AA-PET and other imaging biomarkers in tumor volume delineation in radiation therapy."

104,Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Nivolumab and Valproate in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02648633,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have the potential to treat a wide range of diverse cancers. Of particular interest to researchers is the PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction, a major pathway that many cancers hijack in order to suppress immune control. Anti-PD-1 antibodies such as nivolumab show a strong potential to treat many types of cancers including glioblastoma, the most common and most lethal brain cancer.  This study will examine a means of further focusing immune response on glioblastoma by combining stereotactic ""gamma knife"" radiosurgery with nivolumab. The rationale behind this intervention is that the radiation therapy will enhance immune response rate by providing additional tumor antigens from dying cells. Additionally, a study from investigators at Johns Hopkins indicates that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may boost the anti-cancer efficacy of PD-1 antibodies like nivolumab. Valproate, a class I HDAC inhibitor, will be used concurrently with nivolumab with the goal of enhancing the effects of both the nivolumab and the radiotherapy."

155,Pilot Study of Autologous Chimeric Switch Receptor Modified T Cells in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT02937844,"CAR T cell immunotherapy has achieved great success in CD19+ B-cell malignancies. Whether this new generation of cell-based immunotherapy can be applied to solid tumors remain to be investigated, partly due to hostile immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment which favors tumor growth but not immune system. Signaling pathway of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 plays an important role in suppressing immune response against tumors. PD-L1 is over-expressed in 88% of glioblastoma.  We constructed a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) containing the extracellular domain of PD1 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the costimulatory molecule CD28. CSR modified T cells are able to recognize PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and transduce signals to activate T cells, which results in tumor killing. A truncated EGFR (tEGFR) which lacks of the ligand binding domain and cytoplasmic kinase domain of wildtype EGFR is incorporated into the CSR vector and is used for in vivo tracking and ablation of CSR T cells when necessary. This pilot study is to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous CSR T cells in patients with recurrent glioblastoma."

163,Procarbazine and Lomustine in Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT01737346,"The combination therapy of temozolomide and radiation has been established as the standard therapy for the initial treatment of glioblastoma. However, the prognosis for patients with recurrent/ refractory glioblastoma is dismal, with a median survival of 3~6 months. There is no efficient and standard care at the time of recurrence or progression following temozolomide administration. Recently, many clinicians have reassessed the efficacy of second-line chemotherapeutic agents such as nitrosoureas for the treatment of recurrent/refractory glioblastoma. It is very important that the effect of the agent is sustained and the adverse effect is reduced to preserve the quality of life in recurrent settings. We have realized that the clinical features of Korean patients are very different from those of foreign patients. Therefore, it is mandatory to develop the new strategy for the treatment of Korean patients. We modify the PCV chemotherapy in the dose and administration schedule of CCNU and procarbazine to reduce the side effect, especially hematologic problems. The dose of CCNU is reduced to 75mg/m2 and the interval between CCNU and procarbazine is increased. Moreover, vincristine is excluded because BBB permeability of vincristine is very poor and the risk of neurotoxicity is high. We introduce the modified PC chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of recurrent/refractory glioblastoma, which is the first multicenter trial for glioblastoma patients in Korea."
164,Improving Tumor Treating Fields Treatment for Brain Cancer Patients With Skullremodeling Surgery (Neurosurgery),NCT04223999,"Introduction Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low-intensity (1-3 v/m) intermediate frequency (200 khz for GBM) alternating fields that disrupt cell division. The treatment is increasingly used as a supplementary modality for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Recent randomized clinical studies have demonstrated tolerability of TTFields (Optune?, Novocure?) for both newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM and a significant and sustained survival benefit in the former population. Specifically, the addition of TTFields to maintenance temozolomide (TMZ) therapy for newly diagnosed GBM patients, who had completed initial concurrent radio-chemotherapy, resulted in significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (PFS = 6.7 vs. 4.0 months, p<0.001) and median overall survival (OS = 20.9 vs. 16.0 months, p<0.001) compared to maintenance TMZ therapy alone (ef-14 trial) (4). Consequently, TTFields were recently approved by the US FDA and included as a category 1 recommendation in the most recent guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. For recurrent GBM, TTFields monotherapy has been shown to have equivalent efficacy and a superior toxicity profile compared to best practice medical oncological therapy. This led to US FDA approval for this indication in 2011. In addition, a post-hoc analysis of the EF-14 dataset has indicated that the addition of TTFields to 2nd line medical oncological treatment at first disease recurrence leads to an overall survival benefit. Finally, the pride dataset showed that the addition of TTFields to current practice of medical oncological treatment was beneficial.  Recently, the investigators proposed a novel approach to calculate the electrical field distribution induced by TTFields therapy of GBM. The approach utilizes finite element analysis and incorporates personalized MRI data to provide a realistic and individualized estimate of the field intensity distribution, which is associated with the antimitotic efficacy of the treatment. Using this approach, the investigators showed that targeted skull-remodeling surgery, e.g. craniectomy or multiple burr-holes, can provide a substantial and highly focused enhancement (~100%) of the median field intensity in supratentorial tumors, while leaving the field distribution in healthy tissues unaffected.  These results support the theoretical rationale that small and clinically feasible craniectomies may improve the clinical efficacy of TTFields for cerebral hemispheric tumors without compromising patient safety. Based on these findings, the investigators recently concluded an open-label, single arm, prospective phase 1 trial (NCT02893137) to investigate safety and feasibility of SR-surgery with TTFields and best practice neuro-oncological therapy for recurrent GBM. The trial was active from December 2016 to May 2019. The planned total number of patients was fifteen. Eligibility criteria included age > 18 years, first recurrence focal supratentorial GBM (RANO), and KPS ¡Ã 70. Patients were right-censored for OS and PFS at the time of analysis and excluded upon progression, death, SUSARs, or unacceptable AEs. The primary endpoint was toxicity (CTCAEv4.0). The secondary endpoints were OS, PFS, PFS rate at six months (PFS6), objective response rate (ORR) based on the iRANO criteria (14), quality of life (QoL), Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and steroid dose.20 patients were screened, 2 declined, and 3 had KPS < 70. Of the 15 enrolled patients, 4 were excluded prior to TTFields due to radionecrosis/non-recurrence, post-op infection, neurodeficit and withdrawal of consent, respectively. All included patients (11 male and 2 female) had GBM IDH-wt tumors (4 MGMT-methylated). Median KPS was 90 (range 70-100) and median age 57 years (range 39 to 67). All patients received maximum safe resection at recurrence (4 had no residual tumor (RANO), 5 non-measurable disease, and 2 measurable disease). 9 patients received adjuvant bevacizumab monotherapy and 2 temozolomide rechallenge. The mean skull-defect area was 10.6 cm2 (range 7 to 37 cm2) and the median field enhancement 43 % (range 25 to 59%). The median follow-up duration was 10 months and the median TTFields compliance 90% (range 48 to 98%). We observed no SUSARs, no grade 4/5 SAEs, 12 grade 3 SAEs (6 generalized seizures in patients with known epilepsy, 1 post-op infection, 1 diarrhea, 1TIA, 1 fatigue, 1 headache and 1 DVT). The most common grade AE 1-2 was headache 60% CI95%= [32; 84], fatigue 53%, CI95%= [27; 79], skin rash 47%, CI95%= [21; 73], and nausea 40%, CI95%= [16; 68].  Regarding survival results were PFS6 was 64%, CI95%= [35; 85], PFS= 8.8 months, CI95%= [6.2; 13.2], OS= 15.0 months, CI95%= [9.6;16.2], and OS12= 64%, CI95%= [35;85]. One patient had complete response during TTFields. Based on these results, the investigators concluded that skull-remodelling surgery incl. craniectomy is not associated with additional toxicity in combination with TTFields and best practice medical oncological treatment and holds promising potential for improving TTFields outcome by focally enhancing the field intensity in the tumor. The proposed phase 2 trial aims to validate this hypothesis in a randomized comparative setting.  METHODS AND ANALYSIS Trial design The study is designed as an investigator-initiated, prospective, multi-center, multi-national, randomized, minimax two-stage, comparative, phase 2 trial, investigating superior efficacy of the intervention. Patients randomized to the control arm will receive TTFields plus best physician's choice medical oncological treatment (BPC treatment) and patients in the interventional arm will receive SR-surgery in addition to TTFields and BPC treatment. The trial will enroll an expected sample size of 70 patients from 4-6 scandinavian countries with Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, as the Sponsor and coordinating site. The primary outcome will be overall survival at 12 months (OS12) and the trial is designed to detect a 20% increase in OS12 in the interventional arm compared to control (from 40% in the control arm to 60% in the interventional arm). Secondary outcomes will include progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QoL), clinical performance, and objective response rate (ORR). Interim futility analysis will be conducted after 12 months follow-up of the first 52 patients. The trial will be stopped at interim analysis if the OS12 months is lower in the control arm compared to the interventional arm. The trial design and data reporting is in accordance with the consort 2010 statement, the gnosis standards for neuro-oncology trials, recent RANO recommendations for phase 2 trial design in neuro-oncology, and general recommendations for phase 2/3 trial design (16-19). The study will be performed in the period march 2020 to march 2023. The inclusion period is expected to be the first 24 months of the trial.  Participants Seventy (70) patients with progressive GBM according to RANO criteria will be enrolled. Potential trial participants will be identified at an institutional multidisciplinary neuro-oncological tumor boards and subsequently referred for eligibility screening. All inclusion scans are assessed by a trained neuroradiologist. Patients who are immediately ineligible, e.g. due to poor performance status, multifocal disease, significant comorbidity, evidence of extracranial primary tumor, or other excluding circumstances, will not be referred for screening.  Experimental intervention Patients will be randomised 1:1 to one of two study arms to receive either, 1) SR-surgery, TTFields and best practice medical oncological therapy (interventional arm), or 2) TTFields and best practice medical oncological therapy alone (control arm). Best practice treatment will typically also include maximum safe resection. Since the intervention (SR-surgery) is only effective during TTFields therapy, TTFields will continue until 1) patient exclusion from the trial, 2) occurrence of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) related to the intervention, or 3) ethical or medical safety contraindication for further TTFields therapy determined by the investigators. This means that treatment may continue beyond progression, as long as active treatment is indicated, and in some cases as compassionate use.  Sample size and statistical considerations The sample size calculations were based on a randomized, comparative, minimax two-stage design and the binomial primary outcome of OS12 for the patient population treated per protocol, i.e. for whom TTFields therapy was initiated. This means that patients excluded prior to TTFields therapy initiation are not included in the primary outcome analysis. Therefore, additional patients may be enrolled to ensure that the planned sample receives active TTFields treatment. The aim of the trial is to determine whether the intervention is superior to control and thus worthy of further phase 3 investigation. The expected OS12 in the control arm is set to 40% based on the EORTC 26101 trial, in which patients with first recurrence of GBM were treated with lomustine monotherapy or lomustine/bevacizumab combination therapy. The trial showed an OS12 of approximately 30% and we therefore set the expected level of OS12 to be slightly above this threshold given the fact that TTFields is added to the treatment which otherwise represents recommended practice. There are no current studies providing accurate OS12 estimates for a population comparable to the study control arm and we therefore based the estimate on an expected benefit of 10% from TTFields alone compared to EORTC 26101. Setting the probabilities of false-positive and false-negative trial results to ¥á = 0.15 and 1-¥â = 0.80, respectively, and defining the expected target level of OS12 to be OS12 = 0.6, i.e. a 20% absolute increase (and 50% relative increase) compared to the control arm, we calculated a maximum sample size of n = 42 patients in each arm (total n = 84) and an expected total sample size (en = 69.8). The expected sample size en is calculated as en = n1 ¡¿ pet0 + n ¡¿ (1 - pet0), where n1 = 52 is the collective sample size of both groups at interim (stage 1) analysis, pet0 = 0.44 is the probability of early futility termination. The numbers are based on the given statistical parameters and a two-stage minimax design as given in sh jung 2018. Interim futility analysis will be conducted after endpoint assessment of 52 patients and the trial will be terminated if the experimental arm performs worse than the control arm. In this case the futility criterion will be defined as OS12experimental < OS12control and this conclusion will determine futility at marginal power and significance levels of 1-¥â* = 0.80 and of ¥á* = 0.20, respectively. If the trial is not terminated at interim stage 1 analysis, the trial will proceed to enroll a total of 84 patients and terminate when the final OS12 endpoint data have been obtained for all patients.  The secondary outcome measures of hazard rate ratios of PFS and OS will be tested using the log-rank test at the 0.05 alpha level. Time-to-event endpoints will be estimated from the time of randomization. Toxicity and adverse events will be reported using absolute numbers and appropriate risk estimates. Final analysis will be conducted when all patients have been excluded or censored, e.g. due to end-of-trial, or loss-to-follow-up. Subgroup analysis based on prognostic factors will be performed, incl. analysis of patient characteristics in each arm and identification of characteristics of potential responders to the intervention. This will also include a correlation analysis between the calculated field distribution and outcome estimates. Analyses will be based on both the intent-to-treat population and the population proceeding to active therapy (per protocol), i.e. At least four weeks of active TTFields therapy with ¡Ã75% average compliance.  Randomisation and blinding Patients will be randomised immediately upon enrollment in the trial, i.e. prior to initial surgery. Randomisation will be performed using randomization.com and patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive TTFields and best practice medical oncological treatment w/o skull remodeling surgery. The study endpoint assessment committee will be blinded to the intervention. Local principal investigators, co-investigators and sub-investigators will not be blinded, as optimal array planning will require knowledge about skull-remodeling surgery. The operating surgeon performing the skull-remodeling surgery will not be blinded. Patients will not be blinded, as it will be possible for the patient to feel the skull configuration and thereby determine whether SR-surgery was performed.  Risks and safety precautions General safety considerations concerning Optune? therapy are outlined in the related technical and safety material provided by Novocure?. In general, TTFields therapy is regarded a safe and recognized treatment for GBM. The most common adverse effect is local skin rash in the area underlying the transducer arrays. The risk of skin rash will be reduced by slightly moving the arrays during regular array changes. Skin rash may be treated with topical corticosteroids, more frequent electrode replacement and short pauses in TTFields therapy, if needed. The risk of brain injury due to the skull remodeling aspect of surgery is minimal, as the entire operation is performed extra-durally. Minor craniectomies do not pose a significant risk of mechanical brain injury. For larger craniectomies, external protective headgear, such as a cap with mechanical reinforcement over the unprotected brain area, may be used to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury after craniectomy. In the case of post-operative infection or impaired wound healing, antibiotic therapy will be administered. If needed, surgical revision/debridement of the wound and potentially removal of the bone flap may be performed. In such cases, the patient may proceed to receive or continue TTFields therapy at an appropriate time, if it is in the patient's best interest. TTFields therapy following removal of the infected bone flap may be accepted even if the craniectomy size exceeds 30 cm2. In all cases, the decision whether to continue with TTFields therapy after surgery will be based on careful consideration of the expected safety and benefit for the patient. All participants will be advised of situations and adverse events, in which medical attention is required. Investigators or properly trained medical personnel will be available for immediate attention or medical advice specific to the treatment or protocol. Patients will receive contact information to the device support specialist, whom they may contact in case of technical problems or considerations.  Monitoring and quality control The project will comply with international guidelines good clinical practice (ICH-GCP and ds/en iso 14155:2012. Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects - good clinical practice) and be monitored by the local contract research organization (CRO). Source data, verification of consent, and handling of adverse events and near-miss incidents will be subject to 20% sampled monitoring. Full access to all source data, incl. patient records, will be granted in relation to trial inspection by the relevant national competent authorities. Experimental ""waivers"" from the protocol will be registered in the project trial master file and reported to the relevant authorities. Changes to the protocol will be submitted for approval by the relevant authorities in accordance with GCP guidelines and regulations.  Dissemination All results will be published in peer-reviewed international scientific journals and presented at international scientific conferences, regardless of academic conclusions. Positive, negative, and inconclusive results will be publicly available."

166,Effect of NovoTTF-100A in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM),NCT00379470,"PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:  The effect of the electric fields generated by the NovoTTF-100A device (TTFields) has been tested in two pilot trials in humans. The data from these trials suggest NovoTTF-100A may improve time to disease progression and overall survival of recurrent GBM patients. Although the number of patients in the pilot trials is small, The FDA has determined that the data gathered so far warrant testing of NovoTTF-100A treatment as a possible therapy for patients with recurrent GBM.  DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:  Patients with GBM whose disease has recurred or progressed despite standard treatment (Surgery, radiation therapy, Temozolomide treatment) and meet all of the requirements for participation in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:  Treatment with the NovoTTF-100A device, or Treatment with the best standard of care practiced at each of the participating centers.  If assigned to the best standard of care group, patients will receive a chemotherapeutic agent chosen based on their prior treatments and the standard of care practiced at each treating center.  If assigned to the NovoTTF-100A group, the patients will be treated continuously for as long as their disease is stable or regressing. NovoTTF-100A treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrodes on the head. Electrode placement will require shaving of the scalp before treatment. After an initial short hospitalization (24 hours) patients will be released to continue treatment at home where they can maintain their regular daily routine.  During the trial, regardless of whether assigned to the NovoTTF-100A treatment group or the best standard of care group, patients will need to return once every month the hospital outpatient clinics where they will be examined by a physician and undergo routine laboratory examinations. These routine visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing. After progression, if such occurs, patients will need to return once per month for two more months to the outpatient clinic for similar follow up examinations.  During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically. Additionally, routine blood tests and ECG will be performed. A routine MRI of the head will be performed at baseline and after 2, 4 and 6 months. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.  SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:  Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.  Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues. TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200 thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.  The breakthrough finding made by NovoCure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of electric charge.  As a result of these two effects, cancer tumor growth is slowed and can even reverse after continuous exposure to TTFields.  Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach.  In conclusion, TTField hold the promise of serving as a brand new cancer treatment with very few side effects and promising affectivity in slowing or reversing this disease."

169,Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM),NCT00515086,"This was a multicenter, open label, randomized study of RAD001 dosed daily in patients with recurrent GBM. The study was conducted with 2 parallel groups of patients. Group 1 was designed to study the biological effects of RAD001 in patients scheduled to undergo salvage surgical resection, and Group 2 was to enroll patients who were not scheduled for surgery. Patients in Group 1 were randomly assigned to one of three pre-surgery treatment groups (0, 5 or 10 mg/day RAD001 for 7 days).

170,Safety of BBB Opening With the SonoCloud,NCT02253212,"For patients with recurrent malignant gliomas, who have already been treated by a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, few treatment options currently exist. Salvage therapies typically consist of systemic administration of chemotherapy agents, which have been shown to have limited effectiveness as median survival in this patient group is currently only 6 months.  One limitation to the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of brain tumors is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To enhance the delivery of systemically administered chemotherapy agents to brain tumors, an implantable ultrasound device was developed that can be used to temporarily disrupt the BBB. Delivery of pulsed ultrasound, in combination with an ultrasound contrast agent, has been shown to temporarily disrupt the BBB for a duration of more than 6 hours and allow for a significantly increased penetration of systemically administered chemotherapy drugs in pre-clinical studies.  This study will evaluate the safety of temporary disruption of the BBB during carboplatin chemotherapy delivery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. This study will also evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of ultrasound that can be used to disrupt the BBB.  The use of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI will be evaluated for determining the extent and magnitude of BBB opening. Clinical efficacy (Survival) and radiological efficacy (Progression Free Survival) will also be evaluated as secondary endpoints."

178,Epothilone in Recurrent Glioblastoma Patients,NCT00397072,"Malignant gliomas remain among the most devastating cancers, and especially for recurrent GBM no standard treatment has been established to date.  ZK 219477 is a fully synthetic analogue of Epothilone B, a naturally occurring cytotoxic substance. ZK 219477 inhibits microtubule depolymerization, causing cell cycle blockage in G2/M phase and induction to apoptosis. This mechanism of action is similar to that of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel), but epothilones retain activity against multi-drug resistance (MDR) tumours. ZK 219477 demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo considerable anti-tumour activity against a wide range of malignancies, and it is now about to enter phase II studies in a number of selected indications. In pre-clinical model ZK 219477 has demonstrated anti-tumorigenic activity for gliomas tumours both in vitro and in vivo.  ZK 219477 has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, a fundamental characteristic for a potential GBM chemotherapy. In a preclinical PK study, similar concentrations of ZK 219477 were detected in plasma (1.2 ¥ìg/ml) and brain (0.9 ¥ìg/g) after 10 min after i.v. application in scid mice. The AUC brain/AUC plasma was about 0.8, indicating a free access to the brain (Hoffmann J et al. 2004, European Journal Cancer Supplement 2, N 8, p. 159, Abstract 521, ref.17). ZK 219477 produced strong antiproliferative activity in the human glioma cell line U373 inoculated subcutaneous in nude mice (2 mg/kg and 9 mg/kg) as well as paclitaxel (8 mg/kg), but on the contrary of paclitaxel, only ZK 219477 demonstrated antitumour activity against U373 implanted in nude mice (9 mg/kg): 8 complete response out 9 treated mice.  Of interest for GBM indication, ZK 219477 is not metabolized by liver cytochrome P450, which is induced by phenytoin and other anti-convulsion drug, commonly used in post-surgery GBM patients.  The purpose of this single arm phase II study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of ZK 219477 in the treatment of pre-treated, recurrent GBM patients. Aim of the study: The purpose of this single arm phase II study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of ZK 219477 in the treatment of pre-treated, recurrent GBM patients. An optional PK study will be performed in selected patients.  Study Design: Open, monocentric, not randomised, single arm, phase II study. Study medication: ZK 219477 epothilone B analog. Study Population: 15 recurrent glioblastoma patients previously treated by surgery, conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ. The 15 patients for this study, represent the first stage of recruitment according to the statistical design.  Inclusion Criteria:  Histologically proven (at diagnosis) GBM Age between 18 and 70 years KPS ¡Ã 70 Life expectancy of at least 3 months Presence of at least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion on gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI, indicating progressive or recurrent disease at least 8 weeks after standard external-beam radiotherapy Recurrence or progression after treatment with radiotherapy and temozolomide. Also patients with residual disease after surgery for recurrent GBM will be included Adequate bone marrow reserve (leukocytes ¡Ã 3,500/ml, ANC ¡Ã 1,500/ml, platelets ¡Ã100,000/ ml); normal baseline liver (serum bilirubin ¡Â 20 /mol/ L), renal (serum creatinine <150 /mol/L) and cardiac function Absence of infectious disease, debilitating chronic diseases, and known psychiatric disorders Corticosteroid dose stable for at least 1 week Adequate recovery from previous surgery, radiation and chemotherapy Negative pregnancy test at enrolment in females of child-bearing potential Agreement to use highly effective contraception methods in adults of reproductive potential Fully informed written consent  Exclusion Criteria:  Pregnant women Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ZK219477 Uncontrolled inter current illness including, but not limited, to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements HIV-infection Any prior treatment with epothilones, other tubulin-targetting as taxanes (e.g. paclitaxel, docetaxel) and vinca alkaloids (e.g.vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine) Peripheral neuropathy Any concurrent malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix Active infection Breast-feeding Subjects who have received an experimental drug or have participated in a clinical trial within 3 months prior to screening Employees of the investigator or study centre with direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that investigator or study centre  Treatments:  Treatment will be administered on an inpatient basis. ZK 219477 will be administered as an i.v. infusion of 3 hours duration at a dose of 16 mg/m2 BSA every three weeks.  Two dose reductions are allowed in order to manage toxicities: 12 mg/m2 and 9 mg/m2.  Evaluation criteria:  Efficacy evaluation. Primary end-point: Progression Free Survival at 6 months (PFS-6). Secondary end-points: Response rates (CR +PR), Median Survival Time (MST). Safety evaluation. Treatment toxicity will be assessed using CTCAE, Version 3.0, except for neurological toxicity that will be assessed also by means of the Scottish Gynaecological Cancer Trials Group (SGCTG) Neurotoxicity Score and electromyography.  Statistics:  A group-sequential design will be used with the chance of remaining alive and free of progression at 6 months, called ""response"", as primary endpoint. The null hypothesis of a response rate ¡Â 10% will be tested based on the binomial distribution of the response endpoint at a nominal significance level of 0.10 (one-sided). If the observed response rate in the 15 patients is < 20%, the null hypothesis will be accepted and study failure will be concluded. If the observed response rate is ¡Ã 20% (i.e., at least three out of the 15 patients show a response after 6 months), then consideration would be given to studying further. If the observed response rate amounts to at least 5 out of the initial 15 patients, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the study may be stopped after the first stage. Secondary end-points: PFS and MST will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Response, age, KPS, number of surgical procedures performed, previous low grade, and time between end of radiotherapy and start of chemotherapy will be considered variables possibly related to TTP and the time interval between start of chemotherapy and death from any cause (MST). Descriptive statistics with these classified time-to-event variables as subgroups will be provided"

189,"Protein Phosphatase 2A Inhibitor, in Recurrent Glioblastoma",NCT03027388,"Background:  Primary gliomas are an incurable disease in spite of aggressive multimodality therapy consisting of craniotomy, irradiation, and chemotherapy. Therapeutic options for patients with recurrent glioma are limited, and there is an unmet need to identify more effective agents. LB100, a water soluble small molecule novel protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, was commercially developed through a CRADA based on our previous intramural research. This compound has shown to be effective in a variety of cancer types in both in vitro and in vivo models. Preclinical studies indicate LB100 has in vitro and in vivo activity as a single agent as well as potentiating the effect of cytotoxic agents including temozolomide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, and ionizing radiation. LB100 is active in combination with temozolomide or doxorubicin against xenografts of glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, breast cancer, fibrosarcoma, and melanoma. A complete phase I study of LB100 has established its safety and the recommended phase II dose (2.33 mg/m^2, daily for three days every 3 weeks). Although it is a polar compound, rodent studies suggest LB100 has activity in the brain.  Whether LB100 can across the human blood brain barrier (BBB), and at what concentration relative to the plasma level is not known. Characterizing these parameters is important because:  1) Our ongoing in vitro studies indicate that LB100 has distinct mechanisms of action at different drug concentrations (e.g. nM versus uM); 2) There are other brain tumors lacking effective medical therapies but without a BBB. Characterizing the LB100 BBB penetration profile will assist in defining its optimal clinical indication.  Objective:  -To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of LB100 in glioma tumor tissues.  Eligibility:  Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma and grades II-III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. A clear clinical indication for another surgical resection must be present. Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years old. Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60%. Patients must have adequate organ function.  Design:  This is a two stage Phase II, open label, single institution study to determine the PK and PD profile of LB100. The dose (established from a Phase I study) will be 2.33 mg/m^2 delivered intravenously over 2 hours. PK and PD effect of LB100 treated tissues will only be evaluated with pathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor. Resected material demonstrating chemoradiation treatment effect or inflammatory response will not be included in the analysis. PK will be determined by quantitating LB100 in tumor tissues removed at various time points. The primary endpoint is PK response, defined as a binary variable indicating the presence/absence of LB100 in tumor tissues. PD effect is defined as statistically significant elevation of phospho-proteins in treated tumor tissues compared to untreated glioma specimens. Untreated inter-patient baseline variance and standard deviation (SD) will be calculated. Post-treatment PD effect difference greater than 2.5 times the baseline SD is statistically significant at the .05 significance level. Due to relatively small sample size, t-distribution is to be used to calculate the cutoff defining the PD response. Up to 25 patients may be enrolled to obtain 8 evaluable subjects. A two-stage design will be used. Five patients will be initially treated. If at least one of five demonstrates PK activity, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled. PK effect will be declared to be significant if at least 2 of the 8 patients demonstrate a PK response (presence of LB100 in tumor tissue)."

Modulation in scoring as measured by reduction of staining intensity score of one degree or more was reported as a positive response to drug. This portion of the trial would be considered a success if 9 or more participants of 15 participants showed a response. There was a 94% chance of this occurring if the true response rate was 75% and only a 10% chance of this occurring if the true response rate was 40%.  Cohort 2  The primary endpoint for Cohort 2 is the proportion of participants progression free at 6 months (PFS6). Historical comparison data suggest that ineffective therapies in recurrent GBM have a PFS6 rate of approximately 9-16% (Wong 1999; Lamborn 2008). This trial was sized to differentiate between a 15% versus a 32% PFS6. With a total sample size of 50 participants, this design yields at least 90% power with a one sided alpha < 0.1 to detect a true PFS6 rate of at least 32%.

199,TTFields and Pulsed Bevacizumab for Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02663271,"Subjects who have evidence of bevacizumab-refractory GBM will be eligible to participate in this research study. Subjects will undergo 12 months of planned continuous treatment with TTFields followed by pulsed bevacizumab treatment when there is evidence of further progression per RANO, with the option of extending treatment up to a total of 24 months in patients who have not progressed and/or have adequate performance status at the 12 month mark. Pulsed bevacizumab dosing is defined by at least one cycle on and at least one cycle off. A cycle is defined as 8 weeks in length. If after one cycle on, there is no evidence of a repeat response; bevacizumab will be continued for one more cycle. If after two cycles on, there is no repeat response; bevacizumab will be continued with or without other standard chemotherapy until death. If after at least one cycle on, there is evidence of repeat response, bevacizumab will be discontinued for at least one cycle or until progression is noted again per RANO, whichever is later, at which time pulsed bevacizumab will be restarted as outlined above. The investigators believe that this approach will produce peaks and troughs in mitotic activities of glioma cells that render glioma cells more sensitive to the antimitotic activity of Optune during peak growth rates, thus lowering disease burden and increasing survival. In addition, the following will be performed: Bevacizumab will be given at 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Physical examination and quality of life (QoL) assessments will be performed bi-monthly. Brain MRI will be performed every 2 months."

203,Irinotecan Plus Lenalidomide in Adult Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme: Phase I,NCT00671801,"Lenalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it may decrease or prevent the growth of cancer cells.  Irinotecan is designed to stop cancer cells from dividing by causing ""breaks"" in the tumor cell DNA (the genetic material of cells), which may cause the cancer cells to die.  There are 2 parts to this study. In the first part (Phase I) of this study, researchers will try to find the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination. In the second part (Phase II) of this study (after the highest tolerable dose is reached), researchers will try to learn the effectiveness of the study drug combination. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled in Phase I or Phase II depending on which part is open at the time.  Phase I:  For this phase, you will be enrolled in a group of at least 3 participants to begin receiving lenalidomide and irinotecan. The dose of the study drug combination you receive will depend on when you enrolled in this study. At each dose level, if no intolerable side effects occur (after 4 weeks), the next 3 participants will be enrolled to receive a higher dose of the study drug combination. This process will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is reached. You will remain on the same dose throughout this study.  You will take lenalidomide by mouth (capsules) every morning on Days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle. Swallow lenalidomide capsules whole with water at the same time each day. Do not break, chew or open the capsules. In addition, you will also receive 1 additional dose of lenalidomide by mouth before the beginning of Cycle 1 (on Day 0 of Cycle 1).  If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (do NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). If you take too much lenalidomide or overdose, call your study doctor or health care provider or poison control center right away.  You will receive irinotecan by vein over 90 minutes once every 2 weeks (on Days 1 and 15). One cycle of treatment is 28 days long. You will have a ""rest"" period on Days 22-28 where you will not receive any study treatment.  Phase II:  For this phase, you will take lenalidomide by mouth (capsules) every morning on Days 1-21. Swallow lenalidomide capsules whole with water at the same time each day. Do not break, chew or open the capsules.  If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (do NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). If you take too much lenalidomide or overdose, call your study doctor or health care provider or poison control center right away.  You will receive irinotecan by vein over 90 minutes once every 2 weeks on Days 1 and 15. One cycle of treatment is 28 days long. You will have a ""rest"" period on Days 22-28 where you will not receive any study treatment.  Some participants in the Phase II study may also qualify for a component (a subset) of this study that will enroll up to 10 participants who will be undergoing surgical resection (removal of all or part of tissue) of the tumor. If the MRI scan (done during screening) shows that you have tumor regrowth and your doctor has recommended surgery to remove the regrown tumor, you will be eligible for this subset of the study.  For the subset, you will take lenalidomide (in the same manner as mentioned above), before surgery, for 3 days in a row with the last dose to be taken on the day of surgery.  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing on the first and second days that you take the study drug before surgery and on the day of surgery. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.  Also, leftover tumor tissue (removed during your surgery) will be collected and used for testing to learn the effect of lenalidomide on your tumor tissue. The leftover tumor tissue samples will also be stored for research tissue/blood bank after the last participant completes the study. You will have a standard MRI scan and a dynamic MRI scan within 3 days after surgery.  Before your leftover tumor tissue samples can be used for research, the people doing the research must get specific approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of M. D. Anderson. The IRB is a committee made up of doctors, researchers, and members of the community. The IRB is responsible for protecting the participants involved in research studies and making sure all research is done in a safe and ethical manner. All research done at M. D. Anderson, including research involving your leftover tumor tissue samples from this bank, must first be approved by the IRB.  All participants:  During treatment, you will have a complete physical exam and brain and spinal exam (performed by checking your coordination and strength by looking at how you walk and pull objects), which will be done every one cycle if you are in Phase I and every 2 cycles if you are in Phase II. On Day 1 of every cycle you will discuss birth control methods. You will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons each time) for routine tests once a week during Cycle 1 and then every 2 weeks in further cycles. You will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons each time) for routine tests on Day 15 of Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 in further cycles (every one cycle if you are in Phase I and every 2 cycles if you are in Phase II). You will also have a dynamic MRI scan done every 2 cycles after completion of Cycle 2. For all women who are able to have children: You will have a pregnancy test performed by your doctor within 10 - 14 days and 24 hours prior to starting lenalidomide therapy, even if you have not had any menses due to treatment of your disease or had as little as one menstrual period in the past 24 months. If you have regular or no menstrual cycles, you will have pregnancy tests every week for the first 28 days, then every 28 days while taking lenalidomide, when you stop taking lenalidomide, then 28 days after you have stopped taking lenalidomide. If you have irregular menstrual cycles, you will have pregnancy tests every week for the first 28 days, then every 14 days while taking lenalidomide, again when you have been taken off of lenalidomide therapy, and then 14 days and 28 days after you have stopped taking lenalidomide.  Treatment on this study will continue for at least 1 year, as long as the tumor does not grow back and there are no intolerable side effects. Treatment beyond 1 year will be based on whether the study doctor thinks that you may benefit without severe side effects.  If at any time during treatment the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off this study, and your study doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.  Once you are completely off this study for any reason, you will have an end-of-study visit. During this visit, you will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your height and weight. You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living (performance status evaluation). You will have a brain and spinal exam. You will have blood drawn (about 5 teaspoons) for routine tests. This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test for women who are able to have children. About 1 teaspoon of blood will be drawn to test for the ability of your blood to clot normally.  PK and Biomarker testing for Phase I:  If you are in Phase I, the following tests and procedures will be performed:  Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn 6 times per day on Days 0, 1, and 4 of Cycle 1 for PK testing. Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn 3 times per day on Days 0, 1 and 4 of Cycle 1, and 1 time on Day 1 of Cycle 2 for biomarker testing. Biomarkers are chemical ""markers"" in the blood and/or tissue that may be related to your reaction to the study drug. If you experience a skin rash due to an intolerable dose of the study drug, a punch biopsy of your skin will be performed on a rash area of your body. This tissue will be used for testing to help the doctors understand what caused the serious reaction and for biomarker testing. To perform a punch biopsy, a hollow knife tool is used to remove a small coin-shaped sample of tissue.  This is an investigational study. Lenalidomide and irinotecan are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of some cancers. Their combination use is investigational and authorized for use in research only. Up to 51 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

The starting dose of 1 x 105 pfu is determined after toxicology results in the most sensitive species on which a security factor (100x) has been applied; accelerated titration will consist in one patient being administered with the starting dose and one-log dose increment between the three first cohorts.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest TG6002 dose level at which at most 1 Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is observed in 6 patients exposed to that dose level.. The DLT period is defined as the interval between the first TG6002 IV infusion (Day 1) and the 8th day of the 21-day 5-FC treatment occurring on Day 26.  Between consecutive cohorts during dose escalation, an at least 3-week safety interval will be applied, starting from the completion of the DLT period of the last patient of the previous cohort (D26), before the infusion of the first patient of the next higher dose cohort (D47). The initiation of the next higher dose cohort will be determined following an analysis by the DSMB of the safety results from one cycle of TG6002 treatment in combination with 5-FC.  Phase 2a:  Based on the outcome of the Phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts, i.e. RP2D, the Phase 2a will include 24 patients. Patients will be treated IV at the RP2D."

212,"Bevacizumab Alone Versus Dose-dense Temozolomide Followed by Bevacizumab for Recurrent Glioblastoma, Phase III",NCT02761070,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent malignant primary brain tumor, has yet been incurable despite recent progress on its standard of care using TMZ as the main trunk of initial therapy in the newly diagnosed setting. One of the main reasons accounting for the dismal prognosis would attribute to lack of active therapeutic regimens at recurrence.  Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against cardinal angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has recently shown efficacy for recurrent GBM, and has been approved in Japan, thereby being a standard care for recurrent GBM. Since there is no effective drugs or regimens developed at bevacizumab failure, insertion of another active drug prior to bevacizumab induction would enhance survival time for patients with recurrent GBM.  In Japan, there are currently only few chemotherapeutic agents approved and available for GBM. Among them rechallenge with alternating dosing of TMZ have shown certain efficacy with acceptable toxicities for patients with TMZ-pretreated recurrent GBM, thus being a good candidate for the regimen used prior to bevacizumab at recurrence.  The present proposal of sequential administration of dose dense TMZ (7/14d) followed by bevacizumab wishes to define a new standard of care for recurrent disease and hopes to identify the subgroups of patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma that respond particularly well to dose-dense temozolomide regimens.

215,"A Prospective, Open-label, Single-arm Clinical Study",NCT04689087,"PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:  The effect of the electric fields generated by the TTFields has been tested in two ¥² phase trials in humans(EF-11&EF-14). The data from these trials suggest TTFields may improve time to disease progression and overall survival of recurrent GBM patients. EF-11 is a randomized, controlled trial, designed to test the efficacy and safety of a new medical device.Although the number of patients in the trials is small, FDA has approved TTFields as a therapy for patients with recurrent GBM.  DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:  Patients with GBM whose disease has recurred or progressed despite standard treatment (Surgery, radiation therapy, Temozolomide treatment) and meet all of the requirements for participation in the study will be included.Before receiving TTFields treatment, the patient can receive surgery again, and TTFields+BPC chemotherapy can be used after surgery; TTFields+BPC chemotherapy can also be used directly without surgery.  During the trial, TTFields treatment is a cycle (treatment course) every four weeks, and patients are required to complete at least one cycle of treatment. Recommended average daily wearing time ¡Ã18 hours, patients will need to return once every month the hospital outpatient clinics where they will be examined by a physician and undergo routine laboratory examinations. These routine visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing. After progression, if such occurs, patients will need to return once per month for two more months to the outpatient clinic for similar follow up examinations.  During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically. A routine MRI of the head will be performed at baseline and after 2, 4 and 6 months. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic questions about their health status. If the disease progresses, imaging tumor assessment or survival follow-up will be performed every 2 months thereafter, until 12 months of follow-up.  The investigator will use the RANO evaluation criteria for tumor imaging assessment, and classify the objective tumor response as follows: The objective tumor response status based on the evaluation of the target lesion can be: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease ( SD), disease progression (PD).  SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:  Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.  Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues. TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200 thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.  The breakthrough finding made by NovoCure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of electric charge."
216,A Study of Berubicin in Adult Subjects With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT04762069,"Berubicin is one of the first anthracyclines that crosses the blood brain barrier and overcomes drug resistance (i.e. it is not a substrate for multi-drug resistant/breast cancer resistant transporters). A Phase 1 clinical trial of berubicin in patients with primary CNS malignancies demonstrated a durable response (one subject alive 13+ years) as well as stable disease in heavily pretreated patients. Therefore, this phase 2 study is designed to further evaluate Berubicin's activity in patients with rGBM after treatment with standard of care."
217,TTFields and Radiosurgery of Recurrent Glioblastoma +/- 18F-Fluoro-Ethyl-Thyrosine,NCT04671459,"Almost all GBM patients experience recurrent disease. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS),at recurrence, has limitations due to the invasive nature of glioblastoma. TTFields may decrease the tumor aggressiveness outside the target area potentially by multiple pathways, including immunogenic cell death and DNA repair inhibition sensitizing to radiation. We hypothesize that combined SRS and TTFields will be complementary, improving outcomes with minimal toxicity.  In this open-label, phase II trial 40 participants with recurrence will be treated with SRS and TTFields, starting in 2020. Recurrence will be defined on FET-PET or MRI using RANO criteria.  All patients will begin treatment within 14 days from baseline imaging evaluation and at maximum 42 days from screening.  The attempt to obtain the Methyl-guanine methyl-transferase (MGMT) gene promoter methylation and IDH1 and IDH2 mutation from primary tumor are made during the study whenever not defined before entering to the study.  TTFields treatment will be initiated as in clinical routine at patients home. Admission to hospital will not be necessary.  SRS must be delivered within 7 days of TTFields start. A 5-day SRS regimen is allowed. TTFields should be interrupted only during SRS. The sample size of the study was calculated for the comparison of survival against a historical control.Overall survival will be stratified by volume, PET-based treatment, SVZ invasion, MGMT methylation status, time to first progression, and TTFields compliance."

With optimal treatment,consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, median survival is 14.6 months. Most patients have evidence of tumor progression within one year of diagnosis despite treatment. At progression, treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective. Recently, bevacizumab was approved for recurrent GBM patients who fail bevacizumab indicate a short survival, on the order of 10 weeks, an approximate PFS 3 and 6 months of 0%. Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR), Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-Kit, and was recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma. Topotecan is an orally bioavailable topoisomerase I and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha inhibitor with reasonably high central nervous system (CNS)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration Recent pre-clinical reports have begun to argue for the clinical testing of metronomic chemotherapy administration in various cancers. The theory of improved activity of Pazopanib + Topotecan administered metronomically is based on targeting tumor vasculature (both existing capillary endothelial cells and circulating bone marrow derived endothelial cell precursors), immune modulation, as well as tumor cell HIF-1 alpha inhibition, and the induction of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage.

226,Surgery for Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02394626,"Background  Glioblastoma is a malignant, locally invasive brain tumor whose prognosis remains grim despite various intense treatment modalities. In the past, radical surgery was met with skepticism due to the aggressive infiltrative character of the tumor. However, an increasing number of retrospective studies over the last decade suggest a survival benefit for surgery. A recent post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial on the use of the surgical adjunct 5-ALA reported a prolonged overall survival from 11.9 to 16.7 months (evidence level 2a) after more extensive resection. Thus, maximal safe resection has become a mainstay of treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma, followed by adjuvant radio-chemotherapy.  Glioblastoma almost invariably recurs after a median of 6.9 months, leaving but few options for further treatment. Recurrence of glioblastoma after surgery and concomitant adjuvant therapy represents an additional therapeutic challenge and may be treated with second-line pharmacotherapy. In addition, a second surgery may also be considered in highly selected patients.  The rationale for surgery - maximum safe resection - is to prolong survival through reduction of tumor load, and, maybe due to an increased efficacy of adjuvant treatment. However, surgery carries risks of complications, that may result in a decreased functional and survival outcome. The crucial question therefore is whether, to what extent, and at what costs in terms of neurological risks a second resection prolongs survival.  Objective  The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare survival outcome after surgery followed by adjuvant second-line therapy to no surgery followed by second-line therapy in recurrent glioblastoma. An auxiliary objective to primary objective is to compare the survival outcomes of operated patients to control in the subgroups stratified by extent of resection: incomplete resection (non-CRET) vs complete resection (CRET).  Secondary objectives are: assessment of recruitment for all screened patients, comparison of progression-free survival between treatment arms, evaluation of crossover and comparison of patient quality of life between treatment arms.  Safety objectives are: to assess neurological deficits, local infections and morbidity associated to surgery and hospital stay after surgery and during follow-up.  Methods  All patients (¡Ã18 years) with a radiological suspicion of first recurrence of glioblastoma are screened for this trial. Patients eligible for study participation are informed on the treatment options for recurrent glioblastoma (surgery followed by adjuvant second-line therapy, second-line therapy, or palliative therapy alone) by the center investigators. Patients randomized to the control group will receive second-line therapy according to local guidelines. Patients randomized to the interventional group will receive a craniotomy and resection of the tumor followed by adjuvant second-line therapy. Outcome will be measured at 3 months intervals.  Recruitment rate and reason for non-inclusion will be monitored."

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months, and then annually for 15 years."
228,Combined O-(2-[18F]Fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Simultaneous Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Follow-up in Re-irradiated Recurrent Glioblastoma Patients,NCT01579253,"For glioblastoma (GBM) patients it has been proven that a [18F]FET-PET scan is very helpful especially in target volume definition and after the treatment, in turn, the combination of MRI and [18F]FET-PET is diagnostically most useful to distinguish between radiation necrosis and a real progressive disease.  The response to therapy is based on the newly formulated Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Kinetic and static [18F]FET-PET scans are useful to supplement this modality and its own prognostic value concerning relapsing patients will be examined.  The special feature of this study is the use of both modalities in parallel, allowing simultaneous acquisition of morphological changes, functional and molecular imaging.  Secondary methodological issues are dealt with, such as the relationship between contrast uptake, perfusion and [18F]FET uptake. In this regard, the hybrid imaging may serve for hypothesis generation, as in parallel in a unique way of contrast enhancement and tracer kinetics can be investigated (simultaneous contrast-enhanced analysis and tracer application).  In particular, FET kinetics are examined in more detail (for example, differences between increasing and decreasing kinetics) to find ways of how to use certain MRI sequences for better visualization of viable tumor tissue and vice versa ."
229,CD147-CART Cells in Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma.,NCT04045847,Patients autologous T cells are activated and then engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for CD147(CD147-CART). CAR-T cells are expanded in culture and returned to the patient by Ommaya Reservoir at specific cell doses. Three CD147-CART doses patient are planned at 1-week intervals. Serum cytokine level and CAR-T cell number will be measured in whole treatment session.
230,FET-PET for Evaluation of Response of Recurrent GBM to Avastin,NCT01756352,"The PET radiotracer FET provides a measure of large, neutral amino acid transport. This transport is significantly upregulated in malignant brain tumors. FET rarely gives false positive findings in the setting of inflammation seen after high dose chemotherapy or radiotherapy. FET labels low-grade as well as high-grade gliomas, in contrast to FDG, which almost exclusively labels only high-grade gliomas. FET imaging may prove to be particularly useful in the setting of infiltrative tumor, which is not contrast-enhancing on MRI and therefore not detectable with FDG. Management of glioblastoma patients with stable contrast-enhancing disease on MRI but increased signs of edema is difficult. This is because it is difficult to distinguish simple edema from infiltrative tumor. The former is managed with steroids and the latter is managed with chemotherapy, and anti-angiogenic drugs.  FET may be particularly useful in assessing changes after GBM patients receive anti-vascular agents such as Avastin. Avastin is very commonly used in patients after failure of first-line treatment in GBM. Not only is Avastin costly, but it also can have serious side effects such as internal bleeding and gastric perforation, severe hypertension, poor wound healing, and renal toxicity. It is important to know when a patient is failing Avastin treatment so that the drug can be discontinued. Preliminary data in Europe (see figures below) suggests that FET-PET can accurately distinguish Avastin responders from non-responders.  Inclusion Criteria:  GBM patients with changes on MRI suggestive of recurrence who have not yet initiated antiangiogenic therapy. Age ¡Ã 18 Anticipated survival >3 months Able to give informed consent Capable of undergoing scan without the need for sedation or general anesthesia.  Exclusion Criteria:  Active intracranial infection or nonglial brain mass. Recent large intracranial hemorrhage (<1 month; size to be determined by principal investigator) Pregnant or nursing. Quantitative serum hCG testing will be performed prior to the initial and each -subsequent FET- PET scan on all females of childbearing potential. Our BWH Radiation Safety Committee and Partners IRB requires stat serum ©¬-hcG pregnancy tests. Patient lives too far from BWH and/or is unwilling/ unable to return for scheduled imaging visits."

234,Hydroxy-urea and Temozolomide in Patients With a Recurrent Malignant Brain Tumor (Glioblastoma),NCT03463733,"Background  Currently, no standard treatment exists for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (rGBM) and used 2nd line treatments have low (up to max. 20%) response rates and very modest response duration (months). The median overall survival for GBM patients is 12-14 months from the time of diagnosis; therefore the development of new therapeutic options is imperative. HU has been used to treat hematological diseases and solid tumors (such as melanoma, ovarian, squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma and brain tumors) in combination with other anti-cancer agents, but never with TMZ. If found safe, HU+TMZ, is easily translated to the clinic.  Purpose: Phase I trial to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of dose intense temozolomide (TMZ) and hydroxy-urea (HU) in (maximal) thirty patients with recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM).  Plan of investigation:  Month 0-24 (1st and 2nd year): Inclusion and follow-up of a maximum of 30 patients with rGBM  Month 25-31 (3rd year): Follow-up of patients included in the trial, data analysis (determining MTD and explorative analysis) and manuscript preparation.  Possible results:  Obtaining MTD and safety profile of daily HU+TMZ in patients with rGBM; Preliminary data on the estimation of the median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), radiographic response proportion in patients with measurable disease, and exploratory correlation of treatment outcomes (PFS and OS) with o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status in archival tumor specimens and further elucidation of underlying mechanism of re-sensitization of TMZ by HU. Exploratory analysis of biomarkers profile of platelets in patients treated with HU+TMZ."
235,Measuring Non-Enhancing Glioblastoma Progression,NCT00777686,"The Study Procedures:  MRI scanning is commonly used to check the status of glioblastoma. In this study, MRI scanning will also be used to try to better understand how chemotherapy that blocks blood vessel growth may be affecting the status of the glioblastoma.  The timing of all MRI scans for this study will be done on schedule for routine patient care. There will not be any extra MRI scans performed, but an MRS portion to the MRI scans will be added. The MRS results will be used in this study to look at the chemical differences between the cancerous and normal tissue, in order to try to better understand how your chemotherapy may be working.  Screening Tests:  Before you can begin this study, you will have ""screening tests"" to help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. The following tests and procedures will be performed:  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test.  MRI/MRS Scanning:  If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have an MRI/MRS scan of the brain. The first of these scans will be performed before the chemotherapy starts (either before your first cycle of this type of chemotherapy or before your next cycle, depending on whether you were receiving this type of chemotherapy before the study or not). After that, an MRI/MRS scan will be repeated at Weeks 8 and 16 after the beginning of chemotherapy.  The MRI/MRS scans will follow the same procedure and use the same MRI scanner machine as a regular MRI scan, but will take about an additional 10 minutes. You will lie still on your back with your head placed within the openings of the scanner. A contrast solution, which helps make the tumor visible, will be given through a needle in your vein. The scanning procedure should take about an hour at each visit.  The results of the MRI/MRS scans will not be used to affect your course of treatment.  Tissue Collection:  If your regular doctor recommends that the tumor be surgically removed, the surgery will be discussed with you in detail and you will sign a separate informed consent form for it. Leftover tissue that was removed during the surgery will be collected and used as part of this study. The tissue will be used to further check the status of the disease, and it will be compared with the MRI/MRS images.  Biomarker Testing:  In this study, you will also have blood drawn for biomarker testing. Biomarkers are chemical ""markers"" in the blood, other body fluids, or tissue that may be related to the status of disease and/or the effects of treatment. This blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn before the chemotherapy starts and then every 8 weeks while you are on study. The blood draws will occur on the same days as the MRI/MRS scanning.  Length of Study Participation:  You will continue having blood drawn for biomarker testing every 8 weeks, unless you stop taking this type of chemotherapy that blocks blood vessel growth. In that case, you will be taken off study.  If you do have surgery, your participation in this study will end after the surgery. If you are unable to have surgery, your participation will end after your last MRI/MRS scan.  This is an investigational study. MRI scanning is an FDA approved and commercially available procedure for checking the status of glioblastoma. At this time and for this purpose, MRS scanning is being used in research only.  Up to 18 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson."
236,Abemaciclib + Pembrolizumab In Glioblastoma,NCT04118036,"This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease.  ""Investigational"" means that the drug is being studied.  Many brain cancers show over expression of a protein called cyclin D1. That means that the body makes too much cyclin D1, which affects enzymes called CDK 4 and CDK 6. Enzymes are substances in the body that help reactions between cells happen. Too much cyclin D1 triggers CDK 4 and CDK 6 to make more cells than normal. This extra cell production leads to the growth of tumors.  In laboratory studies, abemaciclib was able to enter the brain, stop CDK 4 and CDK 6 from making cells, and slow growth of glioblastoma in mice.  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of cancer. Information from these studies suggests that Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) may be beneficial inrecurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection. Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients; an antibody that is made in the lab is also known as a humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to block the action of the receptor, PD-1. PD-1 works to help tumor cells continue to grow and multiply. There are now several approved antibodies for the therapy of cancer and other diseases.  ."

244,Open-Label Pilot Study of OPTUNE? With High Density Transducer Arrays for the Treatment of Recurrent GBM,NCT04492163,"Optune? is a medical device that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent and newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. Optune? has obtained a CE mark in Europe for recurrent and newly diagnosed GBM.  TTFields intensity has been shown to be positively correlated with patient outcome. The new transducer array design is expected to reduce skin heating and thus enable delivery of higher TTFields intensities while keeping the safety profile of the treatment unchanged.  The purpose of the study is to test if delivering TTFields using high intensity transducer arrays for recurrent GBM significantly improves the clinical outcome of patients, compared to using the standard transducer arrays.  The study will enroll 25 patients.  All patients included in this clinical investigation are patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of GBM with first or second radiological disease progression per RANO criteria.  In addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria.  Baseline assessments will be performed to confirm patient eligibility in the study.  Enrolled patients will be treated continuously with the device until disease progression per RANO criteria or 18 months (the earlier of the two) unless any of the treatment discontinuation conditions described under criteria for patient withdrawal or termination are met.  Concurrent brain directed antitumor therapy or procedures beyond TTFields is prohibited.  TTFields treatment will start within 28 days following signing the informed consent.

The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD.  After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 3 weeks, at 6 weeks, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks (for the first 12 patients accrued to the study), every 4 weeks until disease progression, and then every 8 weeks thereafter.  PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22 patients will be accrued for this study."
255,BrUOG 263: Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM),NCT01856933,"PSMA expression has been demonstrated in the tumor neovasculature of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) by immunohistochemical staining. Strong reactivity to the antibody component of PSMA ADC was observed in the endothelial cells of new tumor blood vessels in GBM. Since the endothelial cells are located on the luminal surface of blood vessels, PSMA ADC does not need to cross the blood brain barrier to reach its target. Following binding and internalization of PSMA ADC, the cytotoxic component of PSMA ADC will be released and destroy the neovasculature that supports tumor growth. Therefore, PSMA ADC may be an active treatment for GBM.  Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, has been shown to be effective in improving progression-free survival as a single agent. Thus PSMA ADC, which targets tumor angiogenesis by a mechanism different from that of bevacizumab, may be a novel therapeutic modality for GBM.  A phase 2 study of PSMA ADC is proposed for patients with GBM that have progressed after standard treatment that includes radiation, temozolomide and bevacizumab. A phase 1 study of PSMA ADC in prostate cancer is ongoing and a phase 2 dose level of 2.5 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks has been defined. Treatment after bevacizumab failure for patients with GBM is a major unmet medical need. If activity were demonstrated in this trial, a definitive randomized study would be proposed."
256,A Dose Escalation Phase I Study Of Human- Recombinant Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 Administrated Via CED In GBM Patients,NCT02869243,"This multicentre, open-label, dose escalating, Phase I study will enrol approximately 18 patients with progressive and/or multiple recurrent GBM, who after failure of standard therapies will receive GMP Human- recombinant Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 via intra-tumour and interstitial delivery by CED.  Patients will undergo a resection or biopsy of the tumour, confirmation of viable malignant glioma tumour cells during frozen section performed by the institutional pathologists, and intra-tumor and interstitial placement under neuronavigational guidance of 2 or 3 catheters. No catheters will be placed at time of resection. After resection, catheters will be placed during a separate procedure several days later based upon the patient's condition as determined by both a clinical examination and routine MRI scan.  Patients will receive intra-tumour and interstitial CED of increasing amounts of hrBMP4 solutions (at a starting dose of 0.5 mg) and 1:70 gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) in a total of 44-66 ml over up to 4-6 days at the discretion of the investigator.  Gd-DTPA will be co-infused with hrBMP4 to determine the extent of intra-tumour and interstitial drug delivery. Patients will be hospitalized from the time of the original surgery until the end of infusion of hrBMP4.  Patients will be followed for the duration of the study. The primary endpoint of the study is monitoring feasibility and patient safety for the incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) following intra-tumour and interstitial therapy with hrBMP4 and to determine whether there is a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)."

Fractionated dose regimen (3f - parallel group): 131I-IPA activity will be administered in 3 fractions corresponding to ¨÷ full dose activity (0.67 GBq for the 2.0 GBq dose level). The 1st fraction of 131I-IPA will be administered as above, 1- 3 days prior to  1st XRT. The 2nd and 3rd 131I-IPA fractions will be administered after 5-9 XRT fractions (subject to investigator's discretion and day of IMP administration) following the previous 131I-IPA fraction. The remainder of XRT fractions will be given following the 3rd 131I-IPA fraction.  Fractionated dose regimen (3f - sequential group): 131I-IPA activity will be administered in 3 fractions corresponding to ¨÷ full dose activity (0.67 GBq for the 2.0 GBq dose level). The 1st fraction of 131I-IPA will be administered as above 1- 3 days prior to 1st XRT. The 2nd 131I-IPA fraction will be administered after all 18 XRT fractions have been completed, and the 3rd 131I-IPA fraction will be administered 1 week after the 2nd 131I-IPA fraction. The 2nd and 3rd 131I-IPA injections should be given on the same day of the week, and some hours after administration of the respective XRT dose of that day. The day of IMP administration is subject to change at investigator's discretion. The three different treatment groups at the first (2.0 GBq) dose level (131I-IPA single dose 1f and 131I-IPA fractionated dose either 3f parallel or 3f sequential) will be recruited in parallel, as appropriate. Patients will be allocated to one of the three IPA dosing regimens. N=3 patients will be enrolled for each of the three treatment schedules. A 10th patient can be added to any of the three groups, in order to corroborate evidence for possible differences in safety and efficacy.  Patients at the entry dose level of 2 GBq will undergo 131I-IPA brain SPECT for tumour dosimetry (performed in all patients), whole body planar imaging for determination of biodistribution and whole body safety dosimetry. In addition, these patients will be comparatively assessed for possible differences in safety and/or efficacy among the different dosing regimens.  Dose escalation beyond 2 GBq will be made using the fractionated dosing regimen only, unless the outcome of the 2 GBq dose level suggests otherwise. The best treatment schedule (3f parallel or 3f sequential, see above) for higher doses shall be selected after completion of the 2 GBq dose level.  Dose escalation will be made in steps of 2.0 GBq, i.e. 4.0 (3*1.33 GBq), 6.0 GBq (3*2.0 GBq), up to 8.0 GBq (3*2.67 GBq) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, using cohorts of N=3 patients.  If MTD has not been reached at 8.0 GBq, dose escalation may further proceed, increasing the dose fractions to a total dose 131I- IPA greater than 8 GBq using cohorts of N=3 as follows: 10 GBq, 3f (i.e. 3*3.33 GBq); 12 GBq, 3f (i.e. 3*4 GBq), etc., until MTD is reached or until a satisfactory anti-neoplastic efficacy is observed.  For assessment of possible anti-neoplastic effects during dose escalation, only amino acid-based molecular imaging (preferably 18F-FET-PET) will be used, which allows assessment of treatment-induced changes based on a single post-therapeutic imaging study.  MTD is defined as the dose level, inducing dose limiting toxicity (DLT), in not more than 1/6 of the subjects receiving such dose. MTD will be determined on day 45 from the first IPA injection. DLT is defined as grade 4 neurotoxicity or any other grade 4 toxicity according to NCI-CTC (version 4.03). If DLT is observed in 1 subject of a cohort, 3 additional patients will be treated at the same dose level, under which such toxicity occurred. If one or more of these patients (i.e. 2/4, 2/5 or 2/6) experience grade 4 toxicity, MTD will have been exceeded for the respective dose level. In such a case, 3 additional patients will be treated at the preceding dose level. Therapy-induced early necrosis, (also termed pseudo-progression, which has been associated with improved survival will not be classified as DLT if asymptomatic, or if symptomatic and at least partially reversible within three months with or without therapy. Disease progression/PsPD will be diagnosed according to the current RANO criteria (2017).  The highest dose under which no more than 1/6 of the patients experience DLT will be declared the MTD level. Safety, tolerability and evidence of anti-tumour effects will be compared between all dose levels, in order to identify a most suitable dose level (MSDL) for the phase II part. The MSDL will not necessarily be identical to the MTD, but might be selected by jointly considering efficacy, safety and radiation protection aspects. The identification of the MSDL will be made by a Drug Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), based on an integrated review of efficacy and safety from the first part. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the first part results, the DSMB will make a conclusion regarding safety and efficacy, and recommend to the sponsor a dosing strategy and dose level (MSDL) for the phase II part, if merited. Prior to initiating phase II, the sponsor commits to submit a substantial amendment, containing a summary of the phase I results to the Austrian BASG, other competent authorities, and the responsible Ethics Committee, as appropriate.  Upon establishment of the MSDL, 12-22 further patients will be treated at the MSDL (Phase II). If unequivocal evidence of efficacy is observed, another 10 patients shall be included in the phase II part. It is planned to include approximately 34 (22+12) patients with recurrent GBM with the option to extend phase II study by another 10 patients if the results are encouraging (22+22 patients)."

265,Intracerebral EGFR-vIII CAR-T Cells for Recurrent GBM,NCT03283631,"Patients with evidence of radiographic recurrence who expressed EGFRvIII on their original tumor diagnosis will have autologous PBMCs harvested by leukapheresis. These autologous PBMCs will be transduced with a retrovirus containing the sequences for the EGFRvIII CAR and sent to the Duke Radiopharmacy for radiolabeling with 111Indium (111In). Within 2-3 weeks of leukapheresis, on Day -4 to -2, patients will have a BrainLab MRI to prepare for biopsy and catheter placement. On Day -1, the patient will undergo standard of care (SOC) stereotactic biopsy under local anesthesia to confirm tumor recurrence. At the time of biopsy, prior to catheter insertion and administration of study drug, the presence of recurrent tumor must be confirmed by histopathology. If tumor recurrence is confirmed, a catheter will be placed intratumorally for delivery of EGFRvIII-CARs by Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED).  After biopsy, on the same day, a planning MRI will be performed in the Department of Radiation Oncology for SRS planning and a CT scan will be done for SRS masking. SRS will take place on Day 0 (+1 day) and 111In-labeled EGFRvIII-CARs will be infused on the same day over a 6 to 6.5 hour period immediately after SRS.  On days 1 and 2 after 111In-labeled EGFRvIII-CAR infusion, whole planar imaging followed by Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) Computed Tomography (CT) imaging will assess the intracerebral and systemic localization of the 111In-labeled EGFRvIII-CARs that describes the distribution of EGFRvIII-CARs within the brain and systemically.  This protocol is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a novel, tumor-specific treatment with autologous EGFRvIII-CARs. The proposed starting dose will be 2.5 x 10^8 of 111In-labeled cells in 3 milliliters (mL). Doses will be escalated in successive cohorts. The infusion flow rate will be fixed at 0.5 mL/hr. Infusions of this volume and flow rate have been previously used by us for other therapeutics and have been shown to be safe. EGFRvIII-CARs dose escalation will be accomplished by increasing cell concentration allowing flow rate and infusion volume to remain unchanged. Cell dose will be increased in successive cohorts so long as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not observed as described below.  In the rare event that a sufficient amount of CAR-specific T cells cannot be generated for a patient's intended dose within the dose-escalation portion of this study, the patient will be treated with all cells if within 15% of the intended dose. If the cell number is not within 15% of the intended dose, the patient will be treated at a lower pre-defined dose level using available CAR-specific T cells. If the situation of an insufficient number of CAR-specific T cells occurs within the expanded cohort, all available cells will be administered. If the number of CAR-specific T cells is not within 15% of the intended dose, an additional patient will be treated in the expanded cohort."
266,89Zr-RO5323441 PET Imaging in Glioblastoma,NCT01622764,"Rationale: Glioblastomas (GBM) account for 70% of all gliomas (80% of all malignant brain and CNS tumors) and remain the most aggressive sub-type of glioma, with a particularly poor prognosis. Surgery aimed to complete resection is the first therapeutic modality, however, the infiltrative nature of the disease makes a complete resection nearly impossible. In a randomized, phase III EORTC-NCIC trial, overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with concomitant temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by 6 cycles of temozolomide was 27.2% (95% CI 22.2-32.5) at 2 years, 16.0% (12.0-20.6) at 3 years, 12.1% (8.5-16.4) at 4 years, and 9.8% (6.4-14.0) at 5 years, treatment which is now standard of care. Almost all GBM patients experience relapse and there is no one generally agreed standard of care in recurrent GBM. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), a central regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis, is considered to play a major angiogenic role in GBM. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A, showed a 28%RR,a 43% 6-month PFS and provided a consistent clinical benefit in terms of both delayed progression and increased median overall survival over historical controls. This benefit is limited however, with the tumor eventually evading treatment by for example compensatory upregulation of angiogenic factors like placental growth factor (PlGF). Therefore, targeting PlGF could be a new strategy of tumor angiogenesis inhibition, complementary to VEGF(R) inhibition. In preclinical setting, inhibiting PlGF has shown to inhibit growth and metastasis of various tumors. Humanized monoclonal PlGF antibody RO5323441 was evaluated in phase I trials in healthy volunteers and in cancer patients; no Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) was found, thus no Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) defined. Stable disease was observed in 6/23 patients on different dose levels. A phase I/II study of bevacizumab in combination with RO5323441 is currently ongoing in patients with recurrent GBM (NCT01308684). However, the amount of RO5323441 to reach the recurrent GBM, and how this is affected by bevacizumab treatment, are yet unknown. This can be determined by repetitive measurement of RO5323441 tumor uptake with 89Zr-RO5323441 PET.  Objectives: The objectives of this study are to assess the penetration of RO532441 into recurrent GBM by 89Zr-RO5323441 PET imaging and to quantify its uptake, to visualize and quantify 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organ distribution, and to measure the effect of bevacizumab treatment on 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake in recurrent GBM.  Study design: This is a single center, investigator driven, 89Zr-RO5323441 PET imaging and bio-distribution study in patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight i.v. in 90 min on day 1 is given every 2 weeks in cycles of 6 weeks. The treatment with bevacizumab will continue until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal or patient's best interest. 89Zr-RO5323441 will be administered i.v. at a tracer dose of 5 mg (37 MBq) on day -3 and on day 11 of cycle 1 of bevacizumab treatment. Four PET scans will be performed (2 brain only PET scans and 2 whole body PET scans). Brain only PET scans will be performed 2 hours after each 89Zr-RO5323441 administration on day -3 and day 11, and will take 10 minutes/ scan. Whole body PET scans will be performed 4 days after each 89Zr-RO5323441 administration (before dosing with bevacizumab on day 1 and day 15), and will take 50 minutes/ scan. 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake values in recurrent GBM lesions at baseline and day 15 will be compared to assess bevacizumab effect on tracer tumor uptake. The purpose of the two early brain-only PET scans after each 89Zr-RO5323441 injection is to identify whether changes in 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake in recurrent GBM lesions following treatment with bevacizumab can be solely attributed to an effect on blood volume/ vascular permeability, or rather indicate a possible modulation of placental growth factor (PlGF) level in the tumor tissue. The rationale for the whole body 89Zr-RO5323441 PET scans is to assess 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organs distribution at baseline, as well as to evaluate the influence bevacizumab treatment could exert on 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organs uptake. For 89Zr-RO5323441 pharmacokinetics, blood samples will be taken 1 hour after 89Zr-RO5323441 tracer injection on d-3 and d11, respectively together with the blood samples for hematology on d1 and d15 during the 1st cycle of bevacizumab treatment. The rationale for this is that performing both the 89Zr-RO5323441 PET scan data quantification and the assessment of the tracer's blood pharmacokinetics would enable us to better understand the specificity of 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake in recurrent GBM lesions. Patients will be assessed for bevacizumab treatment response by brain MRI every 6 weeks (i.e. every cycle) in the first 6 month and every 12 weeks thereafter, until documented progression using the updated RANO criteria. Treatment and tracer injection related side effects will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 4.0) for toxicity and adverse event reporting.  Main study parameters/ endpoints: 89Zr-RO5323441 tumor uptake and organ distribution will be scored visually and quantitatively. Standardized uptake value (SUV) and relative uptake value (RUV) will be determined and compared in the recurrent GBM lesions and in relevant tissues at baseline and day 15.  Nature and extent of the burden and risk associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Bevacizumab is registered in The Netherlands for use in metastasized colon and breast cancer, in lung cancer and in advanced renal cell carcinoma and has already been tested in GBM clinical trials. Bevacizumab is expected to have clinical benefit for patients enrolled in this study and similar safety profile compared to the other indications. RO5323441 monotherapy was well tolerated in patients with advanced malignant diseases. In this study, one patient will receive a low total protein dose of 10 mg RO5323441 (2X5mg) in the tracer and it is expected that RO5323441 will not enhance bevacizumab related side effects. The total radiation dose of 89Zr-RO5323441 for a patient participating in this study would be 36 mSv for women and 30 mSv for men. According to the investigators this radiation burden is justifiable in this patient group by the information that can be obtained in this study. Risk: exposure to 89Zr-RO5323441 PET scan-related radiation, possibility of allergic reaction to the protein in the tracer, possible side-effects of bevacizumab."

268,Disulfiram in Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT02678975,"Disulfiram (Antabuse?) is a well-tolerated, cheap, generic drug that has been in use since the 1950s to treat alcoholism. There is now an increasing amount of independent preclinical data to support disulfiram as an anticancer agent. The potency of disulfiram as an anticancer agent seems strengthened by copper. There is now anecdotal clinical evidence of disulfiram as an anticancer agent. So far no clinical studies have been published in glioma patients, but two small, uncontrolled studies are planned according to clinicaltrials.gov. with search 1st November 2015.  The investigators aim to investigate disulfiram and copper-supplement as add-on treatment in glioblastoma patients with recurrence receiving alkylating chemotherapy.

270,Post-approval Study of NovoTTF-100A in Recurrent GBM Patients,NCT01756729,"PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:  The effect of the electric fields generated by the NovoTTF-100A device (TTFields, TTF) has been tested in a large prospective, randomized trial, in 237 recurrent GBM patients. The outcome of subjects treated with the NovoTTF-100A device was compared to those treated with an effective best standard of care chemotherapy (including bevacizumab). NovoTTF-100A subjects had comparable overall survival to subjects receiving the best available chemotherapy in the US today. Similar results showing comparability of NovoTTF-100A to BSC chemotherapy were seen in all secondary endpoints.  Recurrent GBM patients treated with the NovoTTF-100A device in this trial experienced fewer side effects in general, significantly fewer treatment related side effects, and significantly lower gastrointestinal, hematological and infectious adverse events compared to controls. The only device-related adverse events seen were a mild to moderate skin irritation beneath the device electrodes. Finally, quality of life measures were better in NovoTTF-100A subjects as a group when compared to subjects receiving effective best standard of care chemotherapy.  DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:  Patients with GBM whose disease has first recurred despite standard treatment (Surgery, radiation therapy, Temozolomide treatment) and meet all of the requirements for participation in the study will be recruited to one of two groups based on patient preference alone:  Treatment with the NovoTTF-100A device, or Treatment with the best standard of care practiced at each of the participating centers.  If recruited to the best standard of care group, patients will receive a chemotherapeutic agent chosen based on their prior treatments and the standard of care practiced at each treating center.  If recruited to the NovoTTF-100A group, the patients will be treated continuously until tumor progression. NovoTTF-100A treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrodes on the head. Electrode placement will require shaving of the scalp before treatment. Patients will continue treatment at home where they can maintain their regular daily routine.  During the trial, regardless of whether assigned to the NovoTTF-100A treatment group or the best standard of care group, patients will need to return once every month the hospital outpatient clinics where they will be examined by a physician. These routine visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing.  During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically, as well as fill in neuro-cognitive questionnaires. Adverse events data will be collected from all patients.. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.  SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:  TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200 thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.  The breakthrough finding made by NovoCure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of electric charge.  As a result of these two effects, cancer tumor growth is slowed and can even reverse after continuous exposure to TTFields.  Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach.  In conclusion, TTField hold the promise of serving as a brand new cancer treatment with very few side effects and promising affectivity in slowing or reversing this disease."

Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression may cross over to Arm I.  After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter."
273,Ph II SAHA and Bevacizumab for Recurrent Malignant Glioma Patients,NCT01738646,"There is no effective therapy for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) hence such patients remain a major unmet need in oncology. The investigators have recently demonstrated that bevacizumab (BV), a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, has significant anti-tumor activity among recurrent glioblastoma multiforme patients. Vorinostat has modest anti-tumor activity against malignant glioma and can potentiate the action of both chemotherapy and anti-angiogenics. The current study is designed to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of vorinostat when combined with BV among recurrent glioblastoma multiforme patients."
274,PVSRIPO for Recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM),NCT01491893,"PVSRIPO is a genetically recombinant, non-pathogenic poliovirus:rhinovirus chimera with a tumor-specific conditional replication phenotype. It consists of the genome of the live attenuated poliovirus serotype 1 (SABIN) vaccine (PV1S) with its cognate internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element replaced with that of human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2). PVSRIPO has been manufactured at NCI-Frederick, NCI, NIH.  Catheter Implantation: PVSRIPO will be delivered directly into the tumor. A stereotactic biopsy will be performed prior to virus administration for frozen section confirmation of viable tumor and further analysis. The biopsy needle will be placed with stereotactic guidance by a Cosman-Robert-Wells, MRI-compatible, stereotactic head frame or similar frameless device. Immediately following the stereotactically-guided tumor biopsy, a catheter will be implanted in the operating room (OR) at a site the same or different from that used for the biopsy using sterile techniques. A CT may be used to confirm catheter placement post-operatively.  Agent infusion: The entire volume of the agent to be delivered will be pre-loaded into a syringe by the investigational pharmacist and connected to the catheter under sterile conditions in the Neuro-Surgical Intensive Care Unit (NSICU) or neuro step down unit just prior to the beginning of infusion. Drug infusion will occur in the NSICU or neuro step down unit so that all other emergency facilities will be available. Patients will be infused through a Medfusion 3500 or 3010 infusion pump pre-programmed to a delivery rate of 500 microliters/hour. The total amount of the inoculum delivered to the patient will be 3 ml. The virus injection procedure will be completed within 6.5 hours. The catheter will be removed following the post-PVSRIPO infusion MRI.  Biopsy sampling and analyses: Biopsy material will be obtained from tumor tissue prior to virus administration. This tissue material will be subjected to routine histology to confirm tumor recurrence by the study neuropathologist, Dr. R. McLendon or his designate. Molecular genetic tests will also be conducted on extracts of tumor cells from the protocol-specified biopsy prior to PVSRIPO infusion. After acquiring sufficient tissue for standard clinical pathologic testing, up to three additional core biopsies will be obtained, if possible. The additional core biopsies will be used for genetic analysis, including full genome or full exome sequencing, as well as other molecular genetic testing. This testing will include, but is not limited to, DNA sequencing, gene amplification, and gene expression. Additional pathology tests on the protocol-specified biopsy tissue may be included, if a sufficient amount of tissue remains after standard clinical pathologic testing.  Selected patients who benefited from the initial infusion of PVSRIPO within this protocol will be eligible for a second infusion. All procedures previously described will be followed; however, the addition of a single dose of lomustine 8 weeks after PVSRIPO administration will alter the schedule of events that was previously described.  During the dose escalation phase of the study, the starting amount (dose level 1) of PVSRIPO to be delivered was 1.0 x 10^8 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50). Dose level 2 was 3.3 x 10^8 TCID50, dose level 3 was 1.0 x 10^9 TCID50, dose level 4 was 3.3 x 10^9 TCID50, and dose level 5 wase 1.0 x 10^10 TCID50. 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID50) is the unit of measure of infectious virus titer.  To minimize the number of patients treated at low-dose levels during the dose escalation phase, we used a two-step continual reassessment method (CRM) design that included an escalation step and a model-guided step. In the dose escalation phase, dose levels were rapidly escalated as preclinical data suggested that dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) would not occur at any of the five dose levels that were being evaluated. Decisions concerning dose escalation for subsequent patients were based upon the occurrence of DLT during the first 4 weeks after treatment administration. Initially, each patient was observed for ¡Ã 4 weeks before the next patient was treated. Starting at dose level 1, one patient was to be treated at each higher dose level. If no DLT was observed within 4 weeks of administration, then the next patient was to be treated at the next higher dose. If no DLTs were observed among patients treated on the first four dose levels, subsequent patients were to be treated at dose level 5. The escalation step was to be interrupted if a patient assigned to one of the first 4 dose levels or more than 20% of patients treated at dose level 5 experienced a DLT. In that case, further dose escalation or de-escalation would be guided by the likelihood-based implementation of the CRM, in which the one-parameter hyperbolic tangent model would be used to estimate the probability of DLT at each of the 5 dose levels based upon available data. The highest dose level for which this estimated probability is less than 20% would be identified as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  After completion of the dose escalation phase and determination of the MTD, the study protocol was amended to allow continued patient accrual to a dose expansion phase, in order to aid in the determination of the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), and to garner more information about patient safety. The RP2D of PVSRIPO is the safe, therapeutic dose where patients have not experienced undue side effects from PVSRIPO or from the management of cerebral inflammation secondary to PVSRIPO administration. To address difficulties tapering patients off of steriods, the dose was reduced to dose level 2 (3.3 x 10^8 TCID50) for the dose expansion phase. After 6 patients were treated at dose level 2 in the dose expansion phase, due to continued difficulties tapering patients off steroids, the protocol was amended to further reduce the dose to dose level -1 (5.0 x 10^7 TCID50) with the goal of limiting the occurrence of known possible side effects of prolonged steroid use in patients who otherwise benefit from this investigational therapy. After the treatment of 24 patients at dose level -1, despite the fact that these patients were able to remain off significant doses of steroids, the patients benefiting the most from PVSRIPO appeared to be those who had experienced minimal or easily controllable inflammation. Hence, the protocol was amended to reduce the PVSRIPO dose to dose level -2 (1.0 x 10^7 TCID50) with the goal of limiting the occurrence of undesirable burden from inflammation and its treatment on as many subjects (and caregivers) as possible. Based upon additional animal studies, dose level -2 (1.0 x 10^7 TCID50) would also be a therapeutic dose. Reduction to dose level -2 was not due to concerns for the safety of the patients on dose level -1, but due to the observation that less inflammatory reaction appeared to be a predictor of better survival and treatment response. After treating 15 patients at dose level -2, based upon pre-clinical and clinical data collected on dose levels -1 and -2, there was no evidence of pre-clinically or clinically important differences between these dose levels. Therefore, the decision was made to treat all future study patients at dose level -1 (5.0 x 10^7 TCID50)."
275,VAL-083 Phase 3 Study in Temozolomide-Avastin (Bevacizumab) Recurrent GBM,NCT03149575,"This is an adaptive, randomized controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial in adult patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of a recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma (GS), who have been previously treated with surgery (if appropriate), standard of care chemo-radiation with temozolomide, +/- adjuvant temozolomide, and bevacizumab and now have progressive disease during or after bevacizumab. Patients with prior low-grade glioma or anaplastic glioma are eligible, if histologic assessment demonstrates transformation to GBM or GS.  Treatment Groups: Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either the investigational drug (VAL-083) or ""Investigator's choice of salvage therapy"" as a contemporaneous control, in a 2:1 fashion. A total of up to 180 patients with recurrent/progressive GBM or GS will be enrolled; patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms as follows:  Group 1: Up to 120 eligible patients will be randomized to receive VAL-083 at 40 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, and 3 of a 21-day treatment-cycle, for up to 12, 21-day treatment cycles or until they fulfill one of the criteria for study discontinuation (death, intolerable toxicities, investigator's judgment, or withdrawal of consent). In patients who demonstrate response, stable disease or who continue therapy at the discretion of the investigator following initial progression and tolerate therapy, permission to continue treatment beyond 12 cycles will be considered but will require consent of the Sponsor. VAL-083 will be administered as an IV infusion over 30-60 minutes.  Group 2: Up to 60 patients will be randomized to receive ""Investigator's choice of salvage therapy"" until they fulfill one of the criteria for study discontinuation (death, intolerable toxicities, investigator's judgment, or withdrawal of consent). ""Investigator's choice of salvage therapy"" will be limited to the following: temozolomide, lomustine, or carboplatin. The dose level for Investigator's choice salvage therapy (temozolomide, lomustine, or carboplatin), will be in accordance with the product label or institutional guidelines.  In both arms, disease status will be evaluated with clinical and imaging evaluation. Baseline total tumor burden must be assessed by MRI within 2 weeks prior to randomization. For patients randomized to VAL-083, post-baseline tumor assessments are to be performed prior to every other 21-day cycle for VAL-083, i.e., prior to Cycles 3, 5, etc., while the patient is receiving VAL-083 treatment, and then approximately every 42 ¡¾ 7 days while remaining on study. For patients randomized to the Physician's choice salvage therapy arm, post-baseline tumor assessments are to be performed approximately every 42 ¡¾ 7 days while remaining on study, as long as the patient continues to demonstrate response or stable disease or comes off the study.  In both study arms, assessments will include interval medical histories, Karnofsky Performance Status, physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, weight, adverse events, hematology and serum biochemistry, pregnancy test (females), urinalysis, chest x-ray and EKG approximately every 21-days while receiving treatment, as well as MDASI-BT self-reporting assessment when MRI tumor measurements are performed.  In a subgroup of 60 study subjects receiving VAL-083, blood samples will be obtained to determine population pharmacokinetics at pre-dose Cycle 1 Day 1, then at post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 3, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 (or Cycle 4) Day 1 (or Day 3) in accordance with the study subject's assigned sampling block. EKGs will be taken pre-dose and approximately 10 minutes post-infusion Cycle 1 Day 1, prior to the 15 min (15 ¡¾ 5 min) blood draw for PK assessment, as well as pre-dose and approximately 10 minutes post-infusion Cycle 1 Day 3, prior to the 15 min (15 ¡¾ 5 min) blood draw for PK.

Trough levels 24 hr after infusion will also be obtained in these subjects. EKGs will be taken pre-dose and approximately 10 minutes post-infusion Cycle 1 Day 1, prior to the 15 min (15 ¡¾ 5 min) blood draw for PK assessment, as well as pre-dose and approximately 10 minutes post-infusion Cycle 1 Day 3, prior to the 15 min (15 ¡¾ 5 min) blood draw for PK.  Patients will be followed until death to ensure adequate power (90%) for the primary analysis.  Toxicity will be evaluated and documented using the NCI CTCAE version 4.  Quality of life will be evaluated using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT). This questionnaire will be completed by patients at baseline and at the time of each imaging evaluation, until progression.

283,A Study of Intraventricular Liposomal Encapsulated Ara-C (DepoCyt) in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma,NCT01044966,"Despite significant improvements in diagnostic imaging and neurosurgical techniques, the current treatment modalities for high-grade gliomas are inadequate. As such, the median survival for most patients with GBM is on the order of months, even after cytoreductive surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Fewer than 3% of GBM patients are still alive at 5 years after diagnosis. A rising incidence has been reported for GBM, and the survival rate for patients with GBM has not shown improvement in the last two decades. For this reason exploring novel therapies for the treatment of GBM is warranted.  Neuro-oncology is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift in terms of our accepted understanding of the pathophysiology of gliomagenesis. Classic ""dedifferentiation"" hypotheses, modeling the cellular origin of gliomas after neoplastic transformation of differentiated glia, are currently being challenged by hypotheses suggesting dysregulated glial progenitor cells are responsible for gliomagenesis. Growing evidence exists that glial progenitor cells persisting in the adult mammalian brain, lining the lateral ventricles in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus, play a role in gliomagenesis. Gliomas frequently occur in close proximity to the ventricular system and SVZ with high-grade lesions like GBM ""spreading"" to midline structures and crossing the corpus callosum to the contralateral hemisphere. Glial progenitor cells lining the lateral ventricles in the SVZ and dentate gyrus may be the source of ""tumor"" cells ""spreading"" to midline structures such as the corpus callosum as well as continuously replenishing the tumor bed resulting in local recurrences.  The lack of significant clinical advances in treating GBM may be due to oversight of the SVZ component of this disease. It is our hypothesis that successful treatment of GBM will require suppression of the SVZ component in addition to the currently accepted modalities of hemispheric tumor resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy. This understanding of gliomagenesis has not yet been used clinically for the treatment of GBM. We hypothesize that the SVZ is the incubator for future recurrences of GBM and propose targeting SVZ progenitor cells with intraventricular liposomal encapsulated Ara-C (DepoCyt) in combination with systemic metronomic dose temozolomide. Ara-C has been previously demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation and migration of SVZ precursor cells in adult animals. Two patients treated using this novel regimen have demonstrated significant responses warranting further study of this treatment in the Phase I/II clinical trial proposed here. This has also been the basis for successful application and granting of Orphan-Drug designation for cytarabine (Ara-C) liposome injection (trade name: DepoCyt) for the treatment of gliomas (Designation # 06-2348) on January 30, 2007."

287,The PRECISE Trial: Study of IL13-PE38QQR Compared to GLIADEL Wafer in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT00076986,"PRECISE is a Phase III clinical trial of experimental drug IL13-PE38QQR (Study Drug). IL13-PE38QQR is a tumor-targeting agent administered by a continuous infusion directly into the brain around the cavity where the tumor has been removed. Through previous research, this Study Drug has shown potential to control some of the recurrent malignant gliomas, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma.  The Study Drug is made by combining a human protein (IL13) with a portion of a bacterial toxin protein, Pseudomonas Exotoxin (PE). The IL13 portion binds to receptors on the tumor like a ""key to a lock,"" allowing the PE portion to enter and kill those cells. Since tumor cells preferentially bind the drug, normal (healthy) brain cells are much less likely to be damaged by the drug. The Study Drug is delivered through tubing or catheters placed directly into the area surrounding the resection cavity. These catheters will be surgically placed from 2-7 days after the tumor has been removed. A pump is then used to slowly push the drug solution through the catheters using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over a period of 4 days.  The GLIADEL? Wafer is an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and sold for the treatment of recurrent or newly diagnosed GBM. Patients receiving GLIADEL? will have wafers placed at the time of surgery to remove tumor.  Eligible patients enrolled in the PRECISE trial will be randomly assigned to receive either IL13-PE38QQR or GLIADEL? Wafer. Patients will have a 2 out of 3 chance to receive IL13-PE38QQR and 1 out of 3 chance to receive GLIADEL? Wafer."

292,AZD7451 for Recurrent Gliomas,NCT01468324,"BACKGROUND:  Recurrent glioma patients have very limited treatment options. A major cause of gliomarelated morbidity and mortality is the extensive infiltrative and invasive nature of glioma cells. Thus, inhibition of glioma invasion is a potentially promising strategy.  Work in the Neuro-Oncology Branch laboratory of Dr. Howard Fine has identified TrkA as an important signaling receptor for mediating glioma cell invasion. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Trk potently inhibits glioma invasion and tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. AZD7451 is a first in-class inhibitor of Trk.  OBJECTIVES:  To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous twice a day AZD7451 dosing in patients with recurrent glioblastoma not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED).  To generate pharmacokinetic data on continuous twice a day AZD7451 dosing.  ELIGIBILITY:  Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma are eligible for this study. Patients should have failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy.  DESIGN:  This study will accrue up to 60 evaluable patients. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will receive continuous AZD7451 twice a day orally for 28 days. The MTD will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment only. Up to three patients may be enrolled simultaneously at each dose level. The dose of AZD7451 can be progressively escalated if only 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity at the prior dose level.  At the end of Cycle 1, patients may choose to continue to receive AZD7451 until disease progression or until they experience unmanageable drug related toxicity, as long as they are continuing to derive clinical benefit and do not fulfill any of the criteria for removal from protocol therapy. Each cycle during this extension period will last 28 days."

298,Evaluating Therapeutic Response to Novo-TTF,NCT02441322,"The patient is being asked to have 4 MRI scans of their brain over the course of 6 months. Before the patient can participate in the study a negative urine pregnancy test may be required for women of child-bearing age. Each MRI scan will take approximately 1 hour to complete. The first MRI scan will be performed once the patient is enrolled in the Novo-TTF treatment therapy, but prior to the initiation of Novo-TTF therapy. The second MRI scan will be performed up to 2-3 weeks after therapy had begun. The third MRI scan will be performed up to 2 months from the start of Novo-TTF treatment and the last MRI scan will be performed up to 4 months from the start of Novo-TTF treatment.  The MRI study will be conducted at the Center for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy in the Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. The study scans will be very similar to routine clinical MRI scans of the brain.  The patient will be asked to lie on a specially designed bed and a circular antenna will be placed around the patients head. The patient will be given earplugs to wear to decrease the banging noise caused by the imaging process. The earplugs do not block out all sound since the MRI tech's wish to stay in communication with the patient at all times. The MRI techs will then move the patient into the magnet, a large hollow cylinder, until the patients head is at the center. The study will then proceed. The MRI operator will inform the patient of the progress of the study. The patient will need to keep perfectly still during the scanning.  During each MRI scan, the patient will have an intravenous line (IV line) placed. The IV line allows the contrast agent to be injected into the patient's vein. MRI contrast agents are chemicals that travel through the bloodstream. They act like dyes to make MRI pictures brighter and easier to read.  When the study is complete, the patient will be moved out of the magnet. The MRI operator will ask that the patient please get up slowly since the patient has been lying still for a relatively long period of time.  The investigators will also review the patient's medical records for information about medical history, current and past medications and therapies, and other information related to the patient's GBM."

300,Bevacizumab With or Without Surgery for Adult Glioblastomas,NCT01413438,"Objective  The objective of this prospective randomized controlled study is to determine the overall survival benefit of tumor resection in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  Study Population  This study will recruit 42 adults with a diagnosis of recurrent grade 4 astrocytoma into each of two arms, for a total of 84 patients. All participants will be good candidates for elective surgical resection of their tumors according to the previously established NIH Recurrent Glioma Scale (NRGS), which uses performance status, tumor volume, and tumor involvement of critical/eloquent brain areas as prognostic criteria. Patients who require biopsy only or have previously been treated with bevacizumab will be excluded.  Design  Participants will be stratified by NRGS score (NRGS 0 or NRGS 1-2) and randomized to surgery followed by bevacizumab or to bevacizumab alone. Patients assigned to the surgical arm will undergo their procedure within 28 days of randomization. Treatment with bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks will begin at least 28 days later to allow adequate craniotomy wound healing. Patients assigned to the non-surgical arm will start bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks immediately. MRI evaluations will take place within 72 hours of surgery to assess extent of resection, 28 days postoperatively, 96 hours after starting bevacizumab, and then every 28 days until tumor progression is documented. Follow-up assessments will take place every 28 days while on bevacizumab until tumor progression. Once progression is established, patients will be free to pursue further surgical and/or medical salvage therapy as they wish. Patients will be followed until their time of death.  Outcome Measures  The primary outcome measure is median overall survival from the date bevacizumab is started. Secondary outcome measures include the rate of progression-free survival 6 months after starting bevacizumab, median progression-free survival, overall survival rates at 6 and 12 months after starting bevacizumab, objective response rate, health-related quality of life, change in KPS of 20 points or more, time to need for additional tumor therapy, and use of corticosteroids."

Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized prior to surgery in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Toca 511 and Toca FC (Experimental arm, Arm T) or control treatment with one option of standard of care (Arm SOC). Stratification will be done by IDH1 mutation status. A second stratification factor is based on the patient's Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (70-80 vs 90-100). Further, to account for potential differences in treatment choices for the control arm in regions, the trial will be stratified by geographical region during the randomization process.

302,Efficacy and Safety of NaviFUS System add-on Bevacizumab (BEV) in Recurrent GBM Patients,NCT04446416,"This trial will be divided into two stages. The study design and procedures will be as follows:  Stage 1:  Eligible patients will first be administered with BEV 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) infusion. After 30-60 minutes, patients will receive microbubbles (MB) (SonoVue?) 0.1 mL/kg and optimal ultrasound exposure doses (based on the acoustic emission feedback FUS power control algorithm) generated from the NaviFUS System single exposure unit for up to two minutes every 2 weeks to transiently open the BBB.  After 4 weeks of treatment with BEV and single unit FUS-MB treatment, if the patient experienced BBB opening using FUS treatment and BEV IV infusion without any serious adverse effects (such as brain significant bleeding), then the patient may proceed to stage 2.  Stage 2:  Patients who complete stage 1 will enter stage 2 to receive the BEV with MB-mediated multiple units of FUS treatment for up to five minutes (but the maximum exposure time per single unit is two minutes) every 2 weeks for up to 30 weeks or until evidence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with study follow-up, or withdrawal of consent.

304,Dose-Escalation Study of TPI 287 + Avastin Followed by Randomized Study of the Same Versus Avastin for Glioblastoma,NCT01933815,"This multi-center trial is a phase 1/2 study that will be conducted in two sequential phases, phase 1 and phase 2.  Phase 1 of the trial is a dose-escalation study of the safety, tolerability (MTD), and efficacy of TPI 287 in combination with bevacizumab in subjects who have GBM that has progressed following prior radiation therapy and TMZ.  All subjects will be administered TPI 287 as an intravenous (IV) infusion (target duration of 1 hour) once every 3 weeks (Days 1 and 22 of a 42-day cycle) and bevacizumab as a 30 to 90 minute IV infusion once every 2 weeks (Days 1, 15, and 29 of the 42-day cycle). The subsequent cycle will start 3 weeks after the last TPI 287 infusion and 2 weeks after the last bevacizumab infusion, maintaining the once every 3 week and once every 2 week schedule, respectively. The dose of TPI 287 will be escalated in sequential dose cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects, while the dose of bevacizumab remains constant (10 mg/kg). The initial cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at a TPI 287 dose of 140 mg/m2. The next four dose levels will be 150, 160, 170, and 180 mg/m2. Dose levels beyond 180 mg/m2 will be increased in increments of 20 mg/m2 (i.e., 200, 220, 240 mg/m2, etc.). Once a dose level is identified that exceeds the MTD, dose de-escalation will be used to further refine the MTD. Specifically, 3 subjects will be treated at an intermediate dose level, halfway between the dose level that exceeded the MTD and the dose level immediately prior (e.g., 230 mg/m2, if 240 mg/m2 exceeded the MTD). Subjects will be assigned to dose cohorts in the order that they are enrolled; there is no randomization for phase 1. Approximately 20 to 32 subjects are planned for enrollment in phase 1, depending on the dose level at which dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed. Dose modifications and delays will be required as described in the protocol. Subjects may continue on treatment unless they meet one or more of the discontinuation criteria outlined in the protocol. Subjects who are discontinued prior to completing Cycle 1 for any reason other than toxicity will be replaced. Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the study. Subjects will be given a diary to record any AEs or concomitant medications taken between visits. Additional safety evaluations will include physical examination (including neurologic examination), Karnofsky performance status (KPS), weight (body surface area, BSA), vital signs, hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis. Efficacy evaluations will include magnetic resonance imaging [MRI, including both pre and post-gadolinium T1-weighted scans and T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images], corticosteroid usage, and neurologic status (as measured by neurologic exam and KPS).  Phase 2 of the trial is a randomized study of the safety and efficacy of the phase 1 MTD of TPI 287 in combination with bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone in subjects who have GBM that has progressed following prior radiation therapy and TMZ.  Sixty subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either TPI 287 in combination with bevacizumab or bevacizumab alone. For the combination arm, the subjects will be administered TPI 287 as an IV infusion (target duration of 1 hour) once every 3 weeks (Days 1 and 22 of a 42-day cycle) and bevacizumab as a 30 to 90 minute IV infusion once every 2 weeks (Days 1, 15, and 29 of the 42-day cycle). The dose of TPI 287 will be the MTD determined in phase 1, and the dose of bevacizumab will be the same as phase 1 (10 mg/kg). Subjects randomized to the bevacizumab alone arm will be administered 10 mg/kg bevacizumab as a 30 to 90 minute IV infusion once every 2 weeks (Days 1, 15, and 29 of the 42-day cycle). The same dose modifications and delays required in phase 1 will apply to phase 2. Subjects may continue on treatment unless they meet one or more of the discontinuation criteria outlined in the protocol. There will be no subject replacement for phase 2 of the trial. The safety and efficacy evaluations during phase 2 will be the same as those in phase 1. In addition, subjects participating in phase 2 will be telephoned every two months following the final study visit (4 weeks after the last dose of study drug) for up to two years after randomization to follow survival. Subjects that participate in phase 1 of the trial will not be eligible to participate in phase 2 of the trial."

308,Cytokine Microdialysis for Real-Time Immune Monitoring in Glioblastoma Patients Undergoing Checkpoint Blockade,NCT03493932,"Objective  This protocol is being performed to 1) characterize the clinical and 2) immunological response of patients with recurrent glioblastoma to treatment with Nivolumab, together with an anti-Lag-3 antibody, BMS-986016, and to evaluate the safety of brain tumor microdialysis in this patient population.  Study Population  10 patients (total, after replacement for any dropout), 18 years old and older with recurrence of glioblastoma after standard treatment of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.  Study Design  Patients will be screened by study neurosurgeons or neuro-oncologists to verify their confirmed or likely diagnosis of a recurrent glioblastoma. Patients will be offered standard of care therapy, including repeat surgery and/or recommendations for chemotherapeutic agents and other trials. If the patients are deemed to be surgical candidates for their potential recurrence, they will be enrolled in the trial. Enrolled patients will then undergo a stereotactic brain biopsy. If a frozen section confirms a diagnosis of recurrent glioblastoma, two microdialysis catheters will be placed in the brain after the biopsy, and a lumbar drain will also be placed. These microdialysis catheters will sample interstitial fluid in and around the brain tumor every 6 hours. We will collect blood and cerebral spinal fluid samples daily for comparison. After two days (Day 3), the patients will be given one dose of Nivolumab, 240mg IV. We will continue to collect samples every six hours from the microdialysis catheters and daily from blood and cerebral spinal fluid for 5 additional days, after which patients will undergo surgical resection of their tumors and removal of the microdialysis catheters and lumbar drain. Nivolumab, at a dose of 240mg IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks, will be administered after surgery (starting on Day 17(+/- 2 days), two weeks after the first dose on Day 3) followed by BMS 986016, an anti-Lag-3 antibody at a dose of 80mg IV over 60 minutes, until the study neuroradiologist notes tumor progression on MRI or the patient experiences treatment toxicity. While on therapy with Nivolumab and BMS-986016, patients will be seen and examined every 2 weeks +/- two days for signs of toxicity. Patients will be followed for at least three months after the surgical procedure.  Outcome Measures  The primary outcome measures are the proportion of patients who have a measurable increase of interferon gamma levels in the brain tumor tissue after their first dose of Nivolumab as compared to the pre-treatment baseline, the safety of using brain tumor microdialysis to monitor response to immune modulators in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and the safety of the combination of Nivolumab and BMS-986016. Exploratory outcome measures include: 1) To determine the change in interferon gamma production within the tumor microenvironment and in the rest of the body from before and after therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab; 2) To evaluate the pathological response of the immune microenvironment of brain tumor tissue to the first dose of Nivolumab; 3) To evaluate the clinical response (progression free survival, overall survival) of recurrent glioblastoma patients to this treatment combination; 4) To describe the difference in survival between responders and non-responders on this treatment combination; 5) To examine the differences in the immune cells and secreted factors of the tumor environment as compared to the immune cells and secreted factors of the cerebral spinal fluid, blood and, potentially, bone marrow in response to this treatment."
309,Surgical Nivolumab And Ipilimumab For Recurrent GBM,NCT04606316,"The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits. It is expected that about 60 people will take part in this research study.  There are 3 study groups participating in this study and each group receives different study drugs. After screening, participants will be randomized into one of three study groups.  Participants will receive one of the following study treatments prior to undergoing surgery for tumor removal:  Group A receives nivolumab plus ipilimumab Group B receives nivolumab plus placebo-ipilimumab Group C receives two placebo infusions, placebo-nivolumab plus placebo-ipilimumab  Neither the participant nor the research doctor will know which study drugs the participant will receive prior to surgery.  After recovering from surgery, participants will receive doses of study medication based on the study group:  Group A receives nivolumab plus ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 3 doses followed by nivolumab every 4 weeks Group B receives nivolumab every four weeks Group C receives nivolumab plus ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab every 4 weeks  This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. ""Investigational"" means the drug is being studied.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of nivolumab or ipilimumab for your specific disease, but it has been approved for other uses.  Both nivolumab and ipilimumab are antibodies (types of human protein) that work to stop tumor cells from growing and multiplying by immunotherapy.  Immunotherapy is trying to have the body's own immune system work against tumor cells. Nivolumab and ipilimumab have been used in other research studies, and information from those other research studies suggest these drugs may help to stop glioblastoma cells from growing."
310,"Phase Ib, Dose Escalation Study of Oral LDE225 in Combination With BKM120 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors",NCT01576666,"The primary purpose of this study is to determine a combination maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of LDE225 and BKM120 when co-administered orally in patients with advanced solid tumors. Adult patients, aged > 18 years with advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard therapy or for which no standard therapies exist will be eligible for this study.  In the dose escalation part of the study, four groups of patients with the following tumor types will be enrolled: recurrent GBM, metastatic breast cancer, metastatic CRC and advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It is anticipated that approximately 45 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation part. Approximately 15 GBM patients (maximum of 2 patients per dose level) will be enrolled to previously well-tolerated doses during dose escalation if no slot is available in a cohort under active testing. In the dose expansion part of the study, five groups of patients (approximately 15 patients per group) with the following tumor types will be enrolled: recurrent GBM, triple negative metastatic breast cancer, hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+, and Her2-) metastatic breast cancer, gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer, and a combined maximum of 15 patients with metastatic CRC or advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The dose expansion will enroll approximately 75 patients. Accounting for patients who may withdraw or who may not meet the eligibility criteria, it is expected that this study will enroll approximately 120 patients.  This is a multi-center, open-label, dose finding, phase Ib study to determine the MTD and/or RDE for the combination of LDE225 plus BKM120, followed by an expansion part to further assess safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination in patients with advanced solid tumors that are frequently associated with dysregulated Hh and/or PI3K pathways, specifically triple negative metastatic breast cancer, hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+, and Her2-) metastatic breast cancer, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic CRC, recurrent GBM and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer patients. Patients will be treated daily on 28-day cycles. Dose escalation will be dependent on the available toxicity information (including adverse events that are not DLTs), PK, PD, and efficacy information, as well as the recommendations from the Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM)."
311,Immunogene-modified T (IgT) Cells Against Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT03170141,"Background:  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most dangerous and aggressive form of brain cancer. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells have been shown to mediate long-term durable remissions in recurrent or refractory CD19+ B cell malignancies, and thus the CAR-T therapy approach is considered a promising treatment against GBM. Certain antigens are highly specific in GBM, such as epidermal growth factor receptor variant iii, EGFRviii. EGFRviii is a variant form of EGFR protein, and one of the potential target antigens in GBM. Alternative antigens such as GD2 and MucI have also been targeted as potential GBM antigens.  Tumor microenvironment is known to suppressive anti-cancer immune responses. Many immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated marked anti-tumor activities. Instead of infusing antibodies, this study aims to infuse antigen-specific T cells modified with immune modulatory genes (IgT) such as genes encoding immune checkpoint inhibitors. Combination of tumor targeting and immune modulatory activities, the IgT cells could target both the tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment."

314,Proteome-based Personalized Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma,NCT01759810,"The trial will include 60 cases of unresectable recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) after two lines of standard chemotherapy and complete course of radiotherapy.  The first line therapy of GBM involves allogeneic haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), dendritic vaccine (DV) and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs).  HSCs are used to stimulate individualized adoptive immune response, to affect tumor cells (TCs) toxically and to regulate tumor stem cells (TSCs) targeted in order to suppress their reproductive and proliferative potential. To obtain HSC the donor receives 8 subcutaneous administrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with 8-10 hours interval for 4 days. The first three days a single dose is 2.5 mcg per 1 kg weight, the last day the dose is doubled. The stem cells are harvested at day 5. Red blood cells are withdrawn by centrifuging. The content of cell markers is evaluated by flow cytometry. The result is assessed after cytoconcentrate enrichment and removal of mature cells and plasma from it. The preparation is stored in tubes per 4 ml with cryoprotector and 10% polyglucin solution. Stem cell proportion is no less than 0.5x106 CD34+, and lymphocytes proportion is no less than 0.5x109 per one administration.  The sample of brain tumor is obtained through stereotaxic/ endoscopic/ open biopsy from all patients included into the trial. The TCs and TSCs are immunochemically isolated from GBM biopsy sample. One part of tumor sample is used for standard histological, cytological and immunochemical testing, while tumor cells (TCs) and tumor stem cells (TSCs) (CD133+) are isolated from the other part.  Dendritic cells are isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cultured. Tumor sample provides tumor specific antigens to prepare DV.  Preparation of CTLs aims to enhance cytotoxic effect on tumor due to great number of circulating CTLs. CTLs are isolated from about 100 ml of peripheral blood after 3 DV administrations, and of them dendritic cells (DCs) are grown. Then, peripheral blood is repeatedly taken, and lymphocytes are isolated. The CTLs are co-cultured with DCs loaded with tumor antigens (first line therapy) or recombinant proteins identical to key oncospecific proteins (second-line therapy) for several times to expand their number (108-109). Their immunophenotype is detected and CTLs are cryopreserved. The first stimulation of CTLs with DCs lasts 6-8 days, the second lasts 2-4 days, next 2 days the lymphocytes are stimulated for the third and fourth time. And then the received lymphocytes are stimulated by IL-2 for 2 days.  Six months after the first line therapy completion the efficiency is evaluated and the cohort demonstrating efficiency continues the therapy, while cohort demonstrating no efficiency will continue the trial with the second line therapy.  The second line therapy arm (active comparator arm) uses DV with recombinant proteins identical to key oncospecific proteins, autologous CTLs and autologous HSCs with modified proteome.  Autologous HSCs are received from the trial participant as described previously. Cell preparation of HSC for active comparator arm is obtained of the cytoconcentrate of autologous mononuclear cells of peripheral blood after mobilization as specified for experimental arm. Tumor specific antigens for active comparator group are provided by tumor tissue of the patient.  TCs and TSCs as well as HSCs of the patient undergo complete transcriptome mapping and gene expression profiling (CTMGEP) and proteome mapping and protein profiling (PMPP). Key (3 or 4 proteins with maximal normalized intensity) oncospecific proteins (OSP) are determined according to proteome testing of TCs, while proteome profiling of TSCs and use of databases of protein-protein relations permit detection of intracellular signal transduction pathways (ISTP) unaffected by carcinogenesis and capable of regulation. Also, receptor membrane targets to affect these signal pathways (acceptor membrane proteins) are detected, as well as proteins that are able to activate them (protein ligands). CTMGEP of TSCs confirms diagnosed functional ISTP. Mathematical modeling of CTMGEP and comparison with Affymetrix GeneChip Human genome U133A Array data reveals perturbagens able to chemically induce HSCs and to modify their proteome profile in order to provide secretion of requisite protein ligands. The database analysis permits understanding of how changes in gene expression induced by a low-molecular agent or micro RNA corresponds with the changes observed in the examined profile. If correspondence is significant, it is supposed, that the agent or similar agents can initiate the effect. If anticorrelation is significant, the agent is supposed to initiate an opposite effect in gene expression modification. The transcriptome of HSCs is modified by co-culturing mononuclear cells with perturbagens. Their biological efficiency is evaluated in vitro in Homunculus bioreactor. Then preparation is stored as described previously.  Individual DV is prepared from the leukoconcentrate of peripheral blood of the patient. The lymphocytes are isolated, cultured with G-CSF and interleukin-2, conditioned by tumor-specific antigens, TNF-¥á and PGE2 for 48 hours and loaded with recombinant proteins identical to key tumor-specific antigens detected at proteomic testing of TCs. Basic mechanism of individual DV immune effect is elaboration of tumor toxic lymphocytes by the organism of the patient.  CTLs are obtained as described previously. The intervention is described in the appropriate section.  Toxicity will be evaluated according to CTC-NCI criteria. Efficiency is assessed according to the following criteria:  Complete effect - -full disappearance of all tumor foci Partial effect - -reduction of tumor size and/or metastatic foci by no less than 50% and no signs of new neoplasms Stabilization - reduction of tumor foci size by less than 50% and no signs of new neoplasms Progress - growth of tumor foci during the therapy. In case of mosaic effect, when part of foci progresses and part is stable or reducing, the therapy is continued but the cases are analyzed outside the context ""Response to the therapy"""

320,Laser Interstitial Thermotherapy (LITT) Combined With Checkpoint Inhibitor for Recurrent GBM (RGBM),NCT03277638,"Primary Objectives:  Phase I: To determine the optimal timing for combining LITT and pembrolizumab in patients with rGBM:  ? To determine the feasibility, safety, tolerability and side effect profiles for combining LITT and pembrolizumab at various time points pre-LITT vs. post-LITT (Phase I).  Phase II: To estimate the response to pembrolizumab combined with LITT in patients with rGBM;  ? To estimate the response rate after treatment with LITT combined with pembrolizumab in patients with rGBM (Phase II).  To collect and record the side effect profiles for combining LITT and pembrolizumab (Phase I and Phase II).  Secondary Objectives:  To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on systemic immune microenvironment in patients with rGBM. To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on the intra-tumoral immunosuppressive microenvironment within rGBM. Secondary for Phase II, to estimate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after treatment with LITT combined with pembrolizumab in patients with rGBM (Phase II). Measure radiological response using both conventional RANO criterion, a modified RANO (RANOi) designed specifically for immunotherapy response assessment, as well as MRI fingerprinting (MRF), recently demonstrated by the PI and collaborators to accurately and precisely distinguish recurrent GBM from radiation injury. Correlate clinical and radiological response to known biomarkers of GBM such as Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) mutations, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 (IDH-2) mutations, Methyl-Guanine Methyl Transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss and KI-67.  Study Design:  The Phase I component will involve up to two of a possible 3 cohorts of 3-4 patients each for a total of 6-8 evaluable patients. Each patient will undergo a stereotactic biopsy. If GBM or Gliosarcoma is confirmed by frozen section, patients will undergo LITT then treatment with 200 mg pembrolizumab IV. Cohort I will receive pembrolizumab on post operative day 14 and every 3 weeks thereafter. In the event that one patient suffers non-hematologic toxicity of grade 3 or more, or if hematologic toxicity is grade 4 or higher, the investigators will delay the 2nd dose of pembrolizumab by 3 weeks and a 4th patient will be accrued. If there are two patients in the initial cohort with non-hematologic toxicities grade 3, or if hematological toxicity in two patients is grade 4 or higher, the second cohort will delay initiation of pembrolizumab until post operative day 35 after LITT. Conversely, if there are no non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) of grade 3 or higher, the investigators will proceed to cohort IB using the same dose of pembrolizumab given 7 days prior to surgery, then every 3 weeks. Similarly, feasibility and safety will be addressed as above in deciding whether or not to proceed to the next cohort.  The Phase II component of the study will consist of additional patients receiving pembrolizumab at the earliest tolerated time post LITT:  14 days post-op -7 days pre-op; 35 days post-opto achieve a total of 23 evaluable patients at the earliest tolerated dose."
321,Genetically Engineered HSV-1 Phase 1 Study for the Treatment of Recurrent Malignant Glioma,NCT02062827,"M032 is a second-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) that is conditionally replication competent; that is, similar to G207, a first generation oHSV, it can replicate in tumor cells, but not in normal cells, thus killing the tumor cells directly through this process. Replication of M032 in the tumor itself not only kills the infected tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus carries a therapeutic payload--acting as a gene therapy vector, too--and causes the tumor cell to synthesize and secrete an immunity-stimulating protein called Interleukin-12 (IL-12) before it is killed. This IL-12 is released and promotes an immune response against surviving tumor cells, which increases the antitumor effect of the therapy. The IL-12 that is expressed can also produce an anti-angiogenic effect, by interfering with the production of new tumor blood vessels necessary to allow tumor growth. Anti-angiogenic therapies potentially starve the tumor of necessary oxygen and nutrients. Thus, the M032 oHSV produces three different potential mechanisms for antitumor effects. The virus has also been genetically-engineered to minimize the production of any toxic effects for the patient receiving the therapy."
322,Study of Recombinant Human Endostatin Combined With Temozolomide and Irinotecan in Recurrent Gliomas,NCT04267978,"Almost all gliomas relapse. After temozolomide rechallenge or combination with irinotecan, the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6%) of recurrent glioblastoma was about 21%. After treatment with irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen, the PFS-6% of recurrent lower-grade gliomas was 40%. The optimal chemotherapeutics of recurrent gliomas has yet to be determined.  Anti-angiogenesis is a promising therapeutic strategy. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) is the primary driver of angiogenesis in tumors. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF, is the prototypical anti-angiogenic drug and received accelerated approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Bevacizumab inproved the PFS-6% (36%), but had no effect on the overall survival (OS) (9.2 months). Moreover, the effects of bevacizumab are transient and most patients' tumors progress just after a median time of 3-5 months. Recombinant human endostatin (rh-ES) is an endogenous broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitor that has been shown to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy when combining with conventional chemotherapy agents in non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma.  In our previous study, we retrospectively analyzed the effect and toxicity of rh-ES when combined with temozolomide and irinotecan on adult recurrent disseminated glioblastoma. After combined treatment, PFS-6% was 23.3%; the median PFS and OS were 3.2 and 6.9 months, respectively, which were promising compared with that in other studies. Once patients get radiographic remission in a short time (4 months), they may get a long PFS.The combined regimen did not reduce the sensitivity of tumor to bevacizumab. After tumor progression from the combined chemotherapy, bevacizumab usage could help to prolong the survival time (5.1 months versus 2.4 months). Moreover, the toxicities of the combination therapy in this study were manageable.  On the basis of prior clinical experience, we carry out this prospective trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of the combination of rh-ES, temozolomide and irinotecan in patients with recurrent gliomas."

324,A Phase III Trial of With Marizomib in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma,NCT03345095,"The standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma includes surgery, involved-field radiotherapy, and concomitant and six cycles of maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy, however the prognosis remains dismal. Marizomib has been tested in patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma in phase I and phase II studies. In patients with recurrent glioblastoma, marizomib was administered as a single agent or in combination with bevacizumab (NCT02330562). Based on encouraging observations, a phase I/II trial of marizomib in combination with TMZ/RT -->TMZ in newly diagnosed glioblastoma has been launched (NCT02903069) which explores safety and tolerability of this triple combination and which shall help to determine the dose for further clinical trials in glioblastoma. In this context, given that marizomib has been established as a safe addition to the standard TMZ/RT -->TMZ, a phase III study is considered essential to establishing its impact on overall survival."

327,Trial of Ponatinib in Patients With Bevacizumab-Refractory Glioblastoma,NCT02478164,"This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. ""Investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied.  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ponatinib for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.  Ponatinib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by affecting different kinds of proteins in cancer cells. Glioblastoma cells can be driven by mutated forms of a protein called c-kit (KIT) which are present in glioblastoma cells. Laboratory studies suggest that ponatinib has activity against mutated forms of (KIT) which is important in glioblastoma and therefore suggests that ponatinib may help to control the growth of glioblastoma. In this research study the study team is looking to see if ponatinib is safe and is able to control the growth of glioblastoma in people who have not responded to treatment with bevacizumab."
328,Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicine and Prolonged Temozolomide in Addition to Radiotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma,NCT00944801,"Glioblastomas represent 40% of all tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and are among the most lethal tumors. Temozolomide (TMZ) combined with radiotherapy was the first substance to significantly improve the overall survival (to 14.6 months) as compared to surgery and radiotherapy alone and increased the proportion of patients surviving more than 2 years to 26%. TMZ showed the best efficacy in patients with a methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter in part by eliminating stem cell-like tumor cells. Among patients with a methylated MGMT promoter, the median survival after treatment with combined radio-chemotherapy was 21.7 months, as compared to 15.3 months among those who were assigned to radiotherapy only. In the absence of methylation of the MGMT promoter, there was a smaller and statistically insignificant difference in survival between the treatment groups.  Doxorubicin is one of the most effective substances in vitro against cells derived from glioblastoma. However, it has no significant effect in vivo due to poor blood-brain-barrier penetration. In a tumor model, tissue and CSF-concentrations of doxorubicin were substantially increased when sterically stabilized liposomes were used resulting in a comparable clinical response using approximately half of the dose of stabilized liposomes compared to conventional doxorubicin. A pegylated formulation (PEG-liposomal Doxorubicin) even further improved the penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Case series and two phase II-studies in patients with recurrent glioblastoma have shown modestly promising results for PEG-Dox.  In this study, the investigators treated patients with recurrent glioblastoma with 20 mg/m2 PEG-Dox on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. To determine the dose limiting toxicity of PEG-Dox combined with prolonged administration of TMZ, the investigators performed a phase I part ahead of the phase II study. To investigate, by means of a historical control analysis, if the addition of PEG-Dox to TMZ and radiotherapy improves the survival of patients, the investigators chose similar inclusion criteria and identical TMZ and radiotherapeutic regimes as in the EORTC26981/NCIC-CE.3 study."

Avastin was administered intravenously at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Bortezomib was administered on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, & 32 of a 42-day cycle. The dose of bortezomib was 1.7 mg/m2 for non-EIAED patients & 2.5 mg/m2 for EIAED patients. Treatment continued until either evidence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with study follow-up / withdrawal of consent. Brain MRIs were obtained after every cycle.  Bortezomib administration is associated with mild toxicity in most patients, such as fatigue, diarrhea & nausea, constipation & peripheral neuropathy. Less common, bortezomib administration leads to more significant hematologic toxicities & peripheral neuropathies. Most significant toxicities associated with Avastin in recently completed phase II clinical trial at Duke were thrombotic complications & grade 2 proteinuria.

336,Ph II Erlotinib + Sirolimus for Pts w Recurrent Malignant Glioma Multiforme,NCT00672243,"The primary objective of this study will be to determine the 6-month progression free survival of patients with recurrent GBM treated with Erlotinib plus Sirolimus.  This is an exploratory, single-arm, phase II study designed to assess the anti-tumor activity of a combinatorial regimen consisting of Erlotinib plus Sirolimus among patients with recurrent GBM. The combinatorial regimen of Erlotinib plus Sirolimus is rationally designed to simultaneously inhibit upstream (EGFR) and downstream (mTOR) mediators of Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B (PI3/AKT) signaling. In a recently completed phase I study, we determined that an EGFR inhibitor (Gefitinib) can be safely combined with Sirolimus at dose levels that are routinely used in the monotherapy setting. Therefore, the primary endpoint of this study is the probability of progression-free survival at 6 months among recurrent GBM patients treated with standard doses of Erlotinib plus Sirolimus. An important secondary objective is to further assess the safety of Erlotinib and Sirolimus for patients with recurrent GBM."

338,Imaging Perfusion Restrictions From Extracellular Solid Stress - An Open-label Losartan Study,NCT03951142,"For this study losartan, an angiotensin-II inhibitor, is defined as the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The focus of the study is to assess the dose-response relationship of losartan on imaging-based measures of tissue perfusion and mechanical forces in patients with brain tumors. We hypothesize that losartan improves the effect of traditional cancer treatment by alleviating mechanical forces (solid stress) of the tumor microenvironment to improve tissue perfusion, while administration of losartan alone has little effect on cancer patients.  This is an open-label study and no active comparator or placebo will be used. Study participants include adult patients with newly diagnosed- and recurrent glioblastoma, as well as adult patients with metastatic brain tumors from non-small cell lung cancer. The study will assess the safety of losartan treatment and its dose-response relationship on conventional and experimental radiographic characteristics when used alone or as an add-on to standard cancer treatment."

Cycles occur back to back without a break in between. Plerixafor is given as subcutaneous injection (under the skin). The injection should be given at approximately the same time each day (If participants would like the option to administer their Plerixfor in the evening rather than in the morning on non-clinic days, this is a possibility, provided certain conditions are met). The research doctor will specify which days participants should take plerixafor. In general, plerixafor will be given once daily during the first three weeks of every cycle (during part 3, patients will receive plerixafor the last week of each cycle, as well). For the first week (5-7 days) of Cycle 1, the injections will be given in the clinic and the nurses will teach the participant and their spouse/friend/family member how to administer the injections. Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) will be given as an infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle. During Part 1 the investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely in combination with bevacizumab so not everyone who participates will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend upon on the number of participants who have been enrolled and how well they have tolerated their doses. During Part 2, before patient begins their post-surgical cycles of treatment, plerixafor will be administered daily for 5-9 days at the MTD established in Part 1 of the study; patient will continue to surgery; and once recovered from surgery, patient will begin post-surgical cycles of treatment (plerixafor and bevacizumab) at the MTD/regimen established in Part 1 of the study. In addition to taking the study medication, participants will have the following tests and procedures done: physical and neurological exam, assessments of the tumor by MRI or CT scan, routine and research blood tests, routine urine tests, pregnancy test (if applicable), ECG, collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via spinal tap. Participants may remain in this research study as long as their tumor is responding or it is determined that receiving further study drugs will not be safe."
346,Prospective Cohort of Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma: Analysis of MMP2 and MMP9 Expression and Correlation to Neuro-imaging Features.,NCT03526822,"Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. A team recently showed that baseline plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) were correlated to bevacizumab activity in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. To date, the biological rationale of this results remains unknown but MMP2 could be involved in classical angiogenesis while MMP9 could promote vasculogenesis.  The objectives are to correlate the plasma levels of MMP2 and MMP9 to their Ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein tissue expression, activity and to patient neuro-imaging features. To analyze the changes of MMP2 and MMP9 plasma levels during peri-operative period and after radio-chemotherapy.  Methods: Plasmatic levels of MMP2, MMP9, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA), vascular endothelial growth factor-R2 (VEGFR2), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) will be analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in pre-, post-operative period, before radiotherapy, before adjuvant temozolomide and at relapse in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. RNA expression of these factors will be analyzed by reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on frozen tumor samples, whereas protein expression will be analyzed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Enzymatic activity of MMP2 and MMP9 will be analyzed by zymography. Tumor volume, infiltration and perfusion degrees will be analyzed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed before and after surgery and before adjuvant temozolomide. Neuro-imaging characteristics will be correlated to plasma and tissue expressions of these factors.  The expected results are to better define the expression profile of MMP2, MMP9 and the change in their plasma level during treatment, a prerequisite for their clinical use."

353,Tryptophan Metabolism in Human Brain Tumors,NCT02367482,"If you agree to take part in this research study, you will be asked to have:  1. A PET scan, 2. brief clinical questionnaires, and 3. biochemical studies of blood and tumor tissue. You will also have a second PET scan later, 2-3 months after the start of NovoTTF therapy, to determine if there are changes in the tumor that can be detected by PET. Your ability to participate in the study will be based, in part, on the results of the magnetic resonance images (MRI) in your medical chart from earlier clinical procedures. Once we receive the results of the PET scan, these will be compared to the MRI in order to help us analyze the tryptophan uptake in your brain. It will take about 3 hours to complete the PET scan; this includes the completion of the questionnaire, preparation and scanning. The actual scanning time will be 70 minutes. If you are a female of child-bearing age, we will need a small urine sample from you before starting the PET scanning procedure to make absolutely sure that you do not have unknown pregnancy for which radiation exposure might be harmful.  The PET scan will be used to measure the accumulation of the injected radioactive tracer AMT in your brain. To make this measurement more accurate, we will use your clinically obtained MRI scan(s), which was used to diagnose the tumor, to identify the exact location and extent of the tumor. For the PET scan, an intravenous catheter (a small tube placed in your vein) will be inserted for the injection of the AMT for this PET scan. It is the tracer that the PET scanner ""sees"" when performing the scan. The amount of the tracer, which will be given is very small (5 ml, the volume of a teaspoon), and therefore no side effects are expected from the tracer itself. A second intravenous catheter will be inserted to collect blood samples during the scan; a total of less than 2 teaspoons of blood will be collected. Participants may be sedated (put into sleep with some medicine) if they are unable to remain still for the scanning period. On the day of the PET scan, we will ask you to fill out a brief clinical questionnaire, and also an additional multiple-choice questionnaire to screen for potential mood problems (which often coincide with brain tumors). Participants with a potential speech (comprehension) problem will also be administered a brief speech test. The goal of these tests is to identify various clinical problems that can be associated with brain tumors and affected by abnormal tryptophan metabolism that we measure with the PET scan. If you have surgery to remove the tumor, a portion of the removed tissue will be used for biochemical studies. The doctor will not remove more tissue than needed for your care. The blood (obtained during the PET scanning) and tumor tissue (obtained during surgery) will be processed for analysis and stored in a locked container or freezer in a laboratory. In addition, we will review the clinical pathology report, so that we can correlate your PET results to type and grade of the tumor."

356,Imaging Biomarkers of Tissue Microstructure and Vasculature as Predictors of Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT01604590,"This study is for subjects with a diagnosis of a brain tumor called glioblastoma that is being treated with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is a drug that your doctor believes is the best treatment option available to subjects at this time for this type of tumor. Bevacizumab affects the growth of blood vessels by tumors such as glioblastoma, thus effectively starving the tumor of oxygen and food.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a test done by a machine in the radiology department that takes pictures of your body using special magnets, rather than X-rays. With a new MRI scan technique the investigators can take very, very detailed images of the vessel and tumor structure. This project will allow us to compare the images of vessel and tumor structure to the effectiveness of Bevacizumab as a treatment option. With this project the investigators will hopefully develop an accurate way to predict whether or not Bevacizumab will be an effective treatment option for patients."
357,Evaluation Of The Treatment Effectiveness Of Glioblastoma / Gliosarcoma Through The Suppression Of The PI3K/Akt Pathway In Compared With MK-3475,NCT02430363,"A humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immunopotentiating activity. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway.  This study will identify the effectiveness of oral inhibitors of PI3K / Akt pathway in comparison with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)."

368,"Study of VAL-083 in Patients With MGMT Unmethylated, Bevacizumab-naive Glioblastoma in the Adjuvant or Recurrent Setting",NCT02717962,"Recurrent GBM is characterized by a dismal prognosis, with a median overall survival of 6.9 months. While a standard of care is established for the initial treatment of GBM - radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy - management of recurrent disease (NCCN, 2014) remains suboptimal. Treatment options include repeat surgery, re-irradiation, or chemotherapy (including experimental targeted therapies, biologic agents, and immunotherapies). Only a minority of patients has response to these treatments, and the resultant benefits in progression-free and overall survival are in the order of weeks to months.  Prognosis and response to therapy are known to be better in patients with a methylated MGMT promoter gene. Epigenetic silencing of MGMT by promoter methylation is an important factor in predicting outcome for patients with GBM treated with temozolomide. Approximately 66% of GBM tumors are MGMT unmethylated (high expression of MGMT), which through a MGMT repair mechanism, confers resistance to temozolomide, the standard chemotherapy treatment of GBM.  VAL-083, Dianhydrogalactitol (DAG), unlike temozolomide, is demonstrated to be active independent of MGMT resistance mechanisms, in vitro. Thus, it may provide a treatment option for those patients that are considered likely to be poor responders to temozolomide.  This is a non-comparative, two arm, biomarker-driven study with VAL-083 in GBM patients with either recurrent disease (Group 1) or newly diagnosed GBM patients requiring maintenance therapy after chemoradiation with temozolomide (Group 2).  Group 1: A total of up to 83 patients with recurrent/progressive GBM will be enrolled. This will include 35 patients treated at 40 mg/m2 and up to 48 patients treated at 30 mg/m2.  Group 2: Up to an additional 36 newly diagnosed GBM patients who have completed chemoradiation treatment with temozolomide and received no subsequent maintenance temozolomide will be enrolled.  Eligible patients will receive VAL-083 IV on days 1, 2, and 3, for up to 12, 21-day treatment cycles or until they fulfill one of the criteria for study discontinuation (disease progression, death, intolerable toxicities, investigator's judgment, or withdrawal of consent). Disease status will be evaluated with clinical and MRI evaluation every other 21-day cycle, while the patient is receiving VAL-083 treatment, and then approximately every 42 ¡¾ 7 days while remaining on study. Symptom burden will be evaluated using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) completed by patients at baseline and at the time of each imaging evaluation.  Interval medical histories, targeted physical exams, neurologic evaluations, complete blood counts, and other laboratory and safety assessments will be performed approximately every 21-days. Blood samples will be taken at Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose, 15 ¡¾ 5 min, 30 ¡¾ 5 min, 60 ¡¾ 10 min, 120 ¡¾ 10 min, 240 ¡¾ 15 min, and 360 ¡¾ 15 min after the end of the of iv infusion with VAL-083 to determine the PK profile and dose-exposure relationship of VAL-083.

373,Convection-enhanced Delivery of OS2966 for Patients With High-grade Glioma Undergoing a Surgical Resection,NCT04608812,"This study is an open-label, ascending-dose, 2-part study designed to determine the safety and tolerability of OS2966, as well as the optimal infusion parameters when administering OS2966 directly to the tumor and the surrounding tumor-infiltrated brain by CED in participants with recurrent/progressive HGG undergoing a surgical resection.  OS2966 is an anti-CD29 (Beta1 Integrin) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in resistant/recurrent glioblastoma animal models. This study will recruit participants with recurrent/progressive high-grade glioma (HGG; WHO Grade III or IV glioma). The development of effective treatments for HGG has been limited by an infiltrative growth pattern, the blood brain barrier (BBB), and the rapid development of therapeutic resistance.  Convection-enhanced delivery is a specific technique that allows direct delivery of therapeutics to the brain and to brain tumors. Convection-enhanced delivery bypasses the BBB and allows for infusion of therapeutics that would otherwise be excluded from the central nervous system. Importantly, CEDs targeted delivery obviates systemic toxicity.  OS2966 will be delivered by CED using the Infuseon Cleveland Multiport Catheter (ICMC) in both parts of the study. The ICMC is a type of catheter developed specifically for direct delivery of therapies to the brain.  Participants enrolled in this study will undergo 2 staged parts of treatment. In Study Part 1, participants will receive a single intratumoral infusion of OS2966 directly to the contrast-enhancing bulk tumor by CED using one ICMC over 4 hours or until maximal tumor coverage is obtained. In Study Part 2, participants will undergo surgical resection of the previously infused tumor. Immediately following surgical resection, 2 ICMCs will be placed directly into the surrounding tumor-infiltrated brain, and OS2966 will be infused over a 4 hour period and then the catheters removed. To confirm the quality of OS2966 delivery, a gadolinium contrast agent will be added to OS2966 before each infusion in order to monitor the infusion via magnetic resonance imaging.  All participants will be closely monitored clinically, and through the use of imaging assessments to determine how effective OS2966 is at preventing further disease progression. Tumor tissue will be collected in both study parts to evaluate how well OS2966 binds to its intended target and to confirm mechanism of action. All enrolled patients will also receive standard supportive care therapy."
374,Safety Study of VAL-083 in Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma,NCT01478178,"Recurrent glial tumors of the brain continue to be one of the most challenging malignancies to treat. Median survival for patients with recurrent disease is approximately 6 months for glioblastoma multiforme. Bevacizumab is used for treatment of recurrent disease; however patients who fail bevacizumab do not have many treatment options.  Metastases to the brain are the most common intracranial tumors in adults and occur ten times more frequently than primary brain tumors. It is estimated that 8 - 10% of cancer patients may develop symptomatic metastatic tumors in the brain. Systemic therapy is rarely used for primary treatment of brain metastases because many tumors that metastasize to the brain are not chemosensitive or have been already heavily pretreated with potentially effective agents, and poor penetration through the blood brain barrier is an additional concern.  Dianhydrogalactitol (DAG) rapidly penetrates both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in brain tissue. Clinical study of DAG in patients with GBM or with progressive secondary brain tumors is warranted. Patients with secondary brain metastases were allowed to enroll into the current protocol in Cohorts 2 and 3; however, enrollment ceased with Amendment 5 and will not be continued beyond Cohort 3.  This study will utilize a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design, until the MTD or the maximum specified dose has been reached. In Phase 2, additional patients with GBM will be treated at the MTD (or other selected optimum Phase 2 dose) to measure tumor responses to treatment."

383,Border Zone Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Bevacizumab in Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT02120287,"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Unfortunately, despite aggressive surgery, radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy, the prognosis for this disease is poor. It is our hypothesis that GBM is a ""local"" disease wherein treatment failure is due to failure to eradicate tumor cells in the pathways along which the tumor eventually spreads (the ""border zone"").  The investigators hypothesize that treatment volume escalation will be successful at improving overall survival in patients with GBM when appropriate targeting and precision dose delivery is performed in a single treatment session. The 'border zone' of the tumor will be targeted for SRS (defined as a combination of the MRI volume of gadolinium enhancement plus up to 2 cm of the surrounding T2 volume). This represents the volume of tumor infiltrated white matter and is the route of GBM spread. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been used with safety and clinical success with concomitant chemotherapy in solid tumors, including GBM.  The investigators further hypothesize that a combined approach of SRS with this VEGF inhibitor will be an effective strategy for GBM because bevacizumab will maximize the effects of radiation in the treated volume and potentially reduce radiation toxicity in the adjacent brain."

388,Safety of IMRT Treatment With Inhomogeneous Dose in Patients With Relapsed High-grade Gliomas.,NCT04610229,"It is an exploratory, prospective, experimental, monocentric study. Having identified a main safety endpoint (toxicity of radiotherapy treatment) and in the absence of data currently available from previous studies and useful for sizing the sample, the sample is defined according to opportunity and feasibility criteria, (12 cases), with a drawing (3 cases + 3 cases + 6 cases) which provides for two intermediate safety assessment steps one month after the end of the third and sixth patient treatment. The study will be continued only in case of positive evaluation of both steps. For each individual patient the treatment is considered completed if: a) the experimental radiotherapy treatment has been completed; b) the first follow-up radiological assessment (NMR) was performed; c) the study treatment was prematurely interrupted due to lack of efficacy (documented disease progression) or unacceptable toxicity.  Treatment: the treatment foreseen by the protocol foresees the planning and the execution of a hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) treatment, administered in 5 daily sessions, with intensity modulated technique and inhomogeneous distribution of the dose guided by the diffusion images obtained with magnetic resonance (RM). The radiotherapy treatment must start within 7 days from the date of execution of the centering MRI which will include both the classic morphological sequences with administration of contrast medium and functional ones. In selected cases and according to clinical judgment it will be possible to request the revision of the anatomopathological and radiological findings. Radiation technique: for each patient, a radiotherapy treatment plan will be performed with conformed techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with dose redistribution: dose-painting. Positioning and immobilization of the patient: the patient must be treated in a supine position. The arms must be positioned along the body. The use of a knee support is recommended. The garment will be immobilized with a thermoplastic mask and corresponding neck rest supports. TC and planning RM: the planning CT should be acquired possibly with reduced layer thickness that contains the entire volume of the skull and the upper part of the shoulders. This is done to allow the possibility of planning non-coplanar type treatments. The last follow-up MRI, or the radiotherapy centering RM, composed of standard and functional sequences, is used for planning, in addition to those that the neuroradiologist will have considered useful to better characterize the clinical case under examination. More details on this are described in the Technical Annex. Target volume and organs at risk (OAR): the following target volumes must be identified: ? Gross tumor volume (GTV): it is defined using and combining the conventional and advanced sequences of the NMR. ? Planning target volume (PTV): it is represented by the GTV with three-dimensional expansion between 0 and 5 mm according to the problems highlighted during the tumor segmentation phase. See the Technical Annex in this regard. The following risky organs (OAR) must be identified: ? Optical nerves: the definition of the related planning risk volume is also suggested (PRV: organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering TC and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). ? chiasm. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). ? retinas. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). Alternatively the eye globes can be surrounded. ? Encefalic trunk. The following secondary OARs must be identified: ? Lenses / Crystalline. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). ? Healthy brain tissue. It is represented by the encephalon volume minus the PTV. ? Screw. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). Dose prescription: i) Dose to the target: the prescription dose foresees a minimum dose of 30 Gy (6 Gy per session) for the areas with the highest ADC with a gradual increase in the dose of the lower ADC areas. The maximum hypothesized dose is 50 Gy, with a dose of 10 Gy per session to no more than 1cc of the irradiated brain tissue. The treatment plan, however, will be processed in the following order of priority: 1. Compliance with dose limits for primary OARs. 2. PTV coverage. 3. Compliance with dose limits for secondary OARs. Dose limits for primary risk organs: in the scientific literature there are various studies that indicate the dose limits of the organs at risk for brain radiation treatments."

399,"SUTENT (SUNITINIB, SU11248)in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme",NCT00535379,"Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults and shows an incidence of 5/100.000 inhabitants per year1. In Austria, approximately 350 patients are diagnosed with malignant glioma annually. Advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy do only have a minor impact on the natural course of these hardly treatable tumors. The mean survival time of adult patients with GBM is only 9-15 months from the time of diagnosis1,2. Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic approaches based on a better molecular understanding of tumor progression and tumor neovascularization.  Molecular Neurooncology has begun to elucidate the complexity of the transformed phenotype of GBM with the goal to identify important molecular changes in the tumor cell that may be amenable for targeted therapies3.  The elucidation of growth factor receptor signaling pathways responsible for the malignant phenotype is now being translated into molecular therapies. At present, targeted therapies with small molecule inhibitors directed against receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or downstream signaling pathways seem to be the most promising therapeutic approaches by directly influencing oncogenetically altered signaling pathways4. Imatinib Mesylate (STI571, Gleevec) is a potent inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl, PDGFR-¥á/©¬, c-Fms and c-KIT tyrosine kinases. Its ability to inhibit PDGFR signaling suggested therapeutic potential in malignant gliomas, but single-agent imatinib showed only minimal therapeutic activity5. Erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva) and Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa) are potent inhibitors of the Epidermal-Growth-Factor-Receptor (EGFR). However, both inhibitors have also demonstrated only limited activity in GBMs with response rates of 10 to 15% and no significant prolongation of survival6. Tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the farnesyl-transferase and influences the Ras oncogene pathway. Overexpression of Ras is implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant gliomas, but also amplified receptors as EGFR, PDGFR and VEGFR can lead to its downstream activation. Clinical trials with inhibition of the Ras signaling pathway showed also only limited biologic effects in GBM patients7.  3.2. Rationale for SUTENT treatment of GBM Patients Reason for the limited activity of selective targeting single agents, but also chemotherapeutic treatments, in GBM patients is the heterogeneity and redundancy of the molecular pathways in glioma cells8. Therefore, a multi-targeted therapy approach, inhibiting multiple molecular signaling pathways involved in tumor progression and tumor neovascularization seems to be a more promising treatment strategy.  SUTENT (SUNITINIB, SU11248) is a potent multi-target inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, PDGFR-¥á/¥â, FLT3, c-KIT, RET and CSF-1R. This drug has shown good solubility, bioavailability and protein-binding characteristics9 and was highly effective in metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (MRCC)10-12 and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)13,14.  The aggressiveness of GBM is reflected by a diffuse local infiltration into the brain parenchyma and a high tumor vascularization15,16. Neuropathological hallmarks of GBMs are pseudopalisades and microvascular hyperplasia. Pseudopalisades are characterized by an accumulation of hypoxic tumor cells around a central necrosis (Fig. 3A), resulting from increased metabolic demands of tumor cells or vascular occlusion. Such tumor cells express high levels of hypoxia-inducible regulators of angiogenesis, including the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-¥á. HIF-¥á accumulates in the tumor cell and binds with its constitutively present partner HIF-¥â. The HIF complex leads to transcription of hypoxia-induced genes, such as VEGF and PDGF17. These growth factors are secreted into the extracellular space by tumor cells and bind to its high-affinity receptors located on  tumor cells (autocrine action), leading to tumor cell proliferation and survival, but also stimulation of the HIF-¥á protein synthesis and endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes (paracrine action), leading to tumor-related neoangiogenesis18-21.  Therefore, VEGF may induce microvascular hyperplasia (Fig. 1B), a typical form of neoangiogenesis immediately related to pseudopalisading cells16,22. Since necrosis and hypoxia are located in the GBM's core, the most biologically relevant hypoxia-induced neovascularization occurs further peripherally, favouring diffuse infiltration by individual glioma cells and allows peripheral GBM expansion.  Summary of molecular and clinical rationales for SUTENT treatment of GBM patients  The target molecules of SUTENT (i.e. VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT-3, c-KIT, RET) are strongly expressed in GBM tissue and have a crucial role in tumor progression and tumor neovascularization The vascular density in GBMs is among the highest of all human neoplasm Clinical studies with SUTENT demonstrated a radiological response and a significant improvement in progression free survival due to SUTENT treatment in MRCC and Imatinib-resistant GIST In clinical trials using SUTENT the incidence and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was relatively low (MRCC and GIST patients)"

403,"Efficacy, Safety and CNS Exposure of G-202 (Mipsagargin) in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma",NCT02067156,"Glioblastoma (GBM) comprises about 16% of all malignancies of the nervous system and over 50% of all gliomas. Standard of care for newly-diagnosed GBM is a combination of surgical debulking followed by concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Efforts to improve second-line therapy in GBM have met with only marginal success and there is a large unmet medical need for new therapies. G-202 (mipsagargin) is an example of prodrug chemotherapy. It is activated by Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), which is expressed by some cancer cells and in the blood vessels of most solid tumors, including GBM, but not by normal cells or blood vessels in normal tissue.

409,Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Dichloroacetate (DCA) in Glioblastoma and Other Recurrent Brain Tumors,NCT01111097,"Malignant brain tumors are defined as any World Health Organization grade III-IV glioma and any solid tumor metastasis (spread) to the brain. Recurrent malignant brain tumors (RMBTs) are defined as either: 1) malignant tumors, originating in the brain, that have recurred at least once or 2) malignant tumors originating elsewhere in the body that have spread to the brain at least once. They share an increasing incidence, clinical and radiographic characteristics, lack of effective therapies, tendency to recur, and poor outcome. Importantly, recurrent malignant brain tumor's shared characteristics may be usefully exploited by an emerging class of biologic agents called metabolic modulators of which Dichloroacetate (DCA) is the drug in the class most thoroughly investigated clinically. DCA's mechanism of action and tolerability have been extensively demonstrated in the treatment of chronic metabolic disorders. Furthermore, the preciseness of DCA's mechanism of action appears to target abnormal tumor cell metabolism."

411,AEE788 and Everolimus in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Relapsed Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT00107237,"OBJECTIVES:  Primary  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of AEE788 when administered in combination with 1 of 2 different doses of everolimus in patients with recurrent or relapsed glioblastoma multiforme.  Secondary  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen, including acute and chronic toxic effects, in these patients. Determine the single-dose and repeated-dose pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival, in these patients. (Phase II) Determine the antiangiogenic effects of this regimen in these patients.  OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of AEE788.  Phase I: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.  Group 1: Patients receive oral AEE788 once daily and oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Group 2: Beginning at the first occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity in group 1, patients receive AEE788 as in group 1 and a higher-dose of oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28.  In both groups, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Cohorts of 3-6 patients per group receive escalating doses of AEE788 until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.  Phase II: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to eligibility for surgery.  Group 1 (eligible for tumor biopsy, surgical resection, or tumor debulking): Patients receive oral AEE788 once daily at the MTD and oral everolimus once daily for 5-9 days. Patients then undergo surgery. Beginning 15-21 days after surgery, patients receive oral AEE788 and oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Group 2 (ineligible for surgery): Patients receive oral AEE788 once daily at the MTD and oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28.  In both groups, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In both phases, if treatment with AEE788 or everolimus is stopped due to toxicity, patients may continue to receive AEE788 or everolimus alone once daily.  After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for as long as the investigator deems necessary."
412,Zotiraciclib (TG02) Plus Dose-Dense or Metronomic Temozolomide Followed by Randomized Phase II Trial of Zotiraciclib (TG02) Plus Temozolomide Versus Temozolomide Alone in Adults With Recurrent Anaplastic Astrocytoma and Glioblastoma,NCT02942264,"Background:  Zotiraciclib (TG02) is a pyrimidine-based multi-kinase inhibitor that has been shown to have inhibitory effects on CDKs, Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) and Fm-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3). It is orally administered and penetrates blood brain barrier (BBB). There is clinical experience in using Zotiraciclib (TG02) as both a single agent and in combination with other chemotherapy agents for cancer treatment. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent that has proven efficacy in anaplastic glioma and glioblastoma. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma in adults. Both a dose-dense (dd) schedule, 7 days on and 7 days off and a metronomic (mn) daily dosing schedule have been used to treat recurrent high-grade gliomas. Our preclinical data have demonstrated that Zotiraciclib (TG02) down-regulates CDK9 activity and its target proteins, such as anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, XIAP and survivin. A treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02) and TMZ has synergistic anti-glioma effects in a variety of glioma models with different genetic background. This serves as the basis for this proposed clinical trial.  Objectives:  Phase I:  -To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus TMZ using both the dd and mn TMZ schedules in adult patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma/gliosarcoma.  Phase II:  -To determine the efficacy of Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus TMZ versus TMZ alone in patients with recurrent WHO grade III or IV astrocytoma as determined by progression free survival.  Eligibility:  Documented pathology diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma [WHO grade III], or glioblastoma/gliosarcoma (WHO grade IV) with recurrent disease. If the pathology diagnosis is anaplastic glioma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, evidence of either intact 1p/19q chromosomes or molecular features suggesting astrocytic tumor must be present. (including, but not limited to ATRX and/or TP53 mutation) No prior use of bevacizumab as a treatment for brain tumor. No more than two prior relapses for Phase I and no more than one prior relapse for Phase II. Patients must have recurrent disease, either histologically proven or with imaging suggestive of recurrent disease Tumor tissues available for review to confirm the histologic diagnosis. Tumor tissue blocks available for molecular profiling analysis.  Design:  Phase I:  This portion of the study is conducted in two stages: The MTD finding and cohort extension. Two treatment arms and several dose levels are planned. In the MTD finding part, TMZ with two alternate schedules (dd and mn) in combination with Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be administered. A cohort extension of both arms will be performed at each MTD and the treatment arm with a better progression free survival at 4 months (PFS4) will be selected for the combination treatment arm for Phase II. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic studies and neutrophil analysis will be performed during the cohort extension of both arms. A maximum of 72 patients will be enrolled to this component for the trial.  Phase II:  Patients will be randomized between two competing treatment arms: (""winner"" of dd vs mn) TMZ + Zotiraciclib (TG02) versus dd/mn TMZ alone using a Bayesian clinical trial design. The dosage for the combination arm will be derived from the MTD determined in the Phase I  component of the study.  The treatment schedule will be identical to that described above in the phase I component, with each cycle comprising 28 days. Patients will continue treatment until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. At progression, patients randomized to the control arm (Temozolomide [TMZ] alone) will be offered the opportunity to continue TMZ and additional treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02)."
413,Anlotinib Combined With Dose-dense Temozolomide for the First Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma After STUPP Regimen,NCT04547855,"Currently,6 cycles of Temozolomide adjuvant chemotherapy after concurrent radiotherapy and Temozolomide chemotherapy(STUPP regimen)for newly diagnosed postoperative GBM can increase the 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates of patients to 26.5% and 9.8%, respectively. However, most patients are still unable to avoid tumor recurrence and death.Anlotinib is an efficient multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that effectively block the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and reduce tumor microvascular density by targeting VEGFRs, FGFRs, PDGFRs. It has been proved to be safe and effective in advanced lung cancer(including NSCLC,SCLC)after second-line standard chemotherapy failure,and advanced soft tissue sarcoma after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy failure.Here, we prepared to evaluate whether the combination of dose-dense Temozolomide and Anlotinib can preferably improved survival of the first recurrent or progressive GBM after STUPP regimen."
414,A Phase I/II Study of the Photon Radiosurgery System,NCT00179907,"Central nervous system tumors account for approximately 20% of all childhood neoplasms. The treatment modalities used in the primary management of brain tumors are surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in each of these therapeutic approaches. In spite of these advancements local tumor recurrence continues to be an important reason for treatment failure in these children. The local tumor recurrence rate varies according to the primary tumor type, treatment technique and tumor-stage at initial presentation. After conventional treatment, the local tumor recurrence rate ranges from 10% - 40% in tumors like medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma and low-grade gliomas . However in aggressive tumors like glioblastoma multiforme the tumor recurrence rate in spite of the best modern treatments remains at 80-100%.  Radiation therapy has always played a key role in the management of adult and pediatric brain tumors. There has been considerable interest in treating brain tumors using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Gamma knife or Linear accelerator and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). The goal of stereotactic treatment is to deliver a high dose of radiation with high geometric precision to a discrete tumor located in the brain. This is accomplished by the use of rigid immobilization skull frames and CT / MRI information for treatment planning and tumor targeting. Presently there are several therapeutic options available for children with recurrent brain tumors. Reirradiation has been employed in recurrent gliomas, medulloblastomas and ependymomas with stereotactic radiosurgery stereotactic radiation and brachytherapy . Following reirradiation, tumor control rates of 50-70% have been obtained. The radiosurgery doses used in children with radiation recurrent tumors have ranged from 10-24 Gy. The reirradiation has been generally well tolerated with retreatment complications like transient edema, cranial neuropathy or radiation necrosis observed in 10-15% of children. The results with high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow / stem cell transplantation in children with recurrent malignant gliomas, medulloblastoma and ependymoma have been disappointing with significant morbidity and mortality. Intraoperative radiation has also been utilized for the treatment of primary and recurrent brain tumors. In a report from Japan, 17 patients including two children with radiation recurrent malignant brain tumors were treated with intraoperative radiation to doses of 20 - 40 Gy. Intraoperative radiation was delivered using special applicators and electron beams. The radiation was delivered after tumor resection and doses of 23 - 40 Gy were delivered to depths of 0.5-1.5 cm. The median survival for patients with malignant gliomas and other tumors (ependymoma, oligodendroglioma) was 12 months and 51 months respectively. The two children with ependymoma were cured and are currently alive at 134 and 88 months after intraoperative radiation. Three patients developed symptomatic brain necrosis, two of them had relief of symptoms with surgery and one patient died. Three patients also developed postoperative meningitis. In another report from University of Nebraska Medical Center, 49 patients with glioblastoma multiforme were treated with interstitial Cobalt 60 high dose-rate irradiation to a dose of 20 Gy to the tumor with a 1-cm margin. The patients with no prior radiation therapy (Group I) received an additional 40 Gy of external irradiation. Nineteen of these patients (Group II) had been previously irradiated, and they received only interstitial irradiation. The Cobalt 60 probe was guided into the tumor using CT scans and a stereotactic frame. This treatment was well tolerated, one patient had a dural leak and another had a subdural hematoma. There were no cases of meningitis or radiation necrosis. The median survival for Group I and Group II patients were 7 months and 6 months respectively.  The photon radiosurgery system (PRS) is an intraoperative irradiation device that is capable of delivering high radiation doses to brain tumors. This system has recently been approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS)  The Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS) incorporates a miniature, 40 KeV x-ray source capable of delivering a prescribed radiation dose directly to a target volume. The PRS consists in part of an electron beam-activated x-ray source with a sealed vacuum tube that is 10 cm long and 3.2 mm in outer diameter that is designed for insertion into the body. This vacuum tube incorporates an electron beam target on the inside surface of its tip. When an accelerated electron beam is generated and sent down the tube to strike the target, Bremsstrahlung and line x-rays are emitted from the tip of the tube in a nearly isotropic pattern.  Measurements of dose-rate in a water phantom have determined that the x-ray beam emanates essentially, from a point source, with a nominal dose rate of 150 cGy/min at 10 mm, for a beam current of 40 uA and a voltage of 40 kV. The absolute dose is estimated to be + 10%. The dose distribution in water falls off approximately as a function of the third power of the distance from the power source. The generator is light weighed, only 3.45 lbs. The radiation dose is adjusted by accelerating voltage (ranging from 30 to 50kV), beam current (ranging from 5 to 40 uA) and treatment time (0-60 minutes) through the control console that weighs only 40lbs. The lightweight of PRS system readily allows us to carry the device to the laboratory and the operating room.  For use of the PRS as an adjuvant treatment, treatment applicators made from a rigid biocompatible plastic (ULTEM 1000) with known x-ray transmission characteristics are used. The inside is hollowed out to allow introduction of the PRS x-ray probe to the epicenter of the applicator so that the dose at its outer surface is uniform. The end of the applicators is spherical with its diameter ranging from 1.5 cm to 4 cm. Treatment applicators will be sterilized prior to each use. The applicator is inserted into the tumor-resected cavity to deliver the prescribed dose of radiation.  The operation and dose characteristics of the PRS combine advantages of external beam radiosurgery with those of brachytherapy (implantation of radiation seeds). As with brachytherapy, the PRS can be located very precisely within the target volume, and can improve the delivery of conformal therapy by irradiating the target volume precisely, with little or no scatter of radiation. Due to its very rapid dose fall-off, the PRS significantly reduces the radiation dose delivered to healthy tissues as compared with external beam radiation and radiosurgery. Like radiosurgery, however, the PRS has a very high dose rate and can deliver high radiation doses to the target volume. Another distinct advantage of the PRS system is the ability to significantly decrease the radiation dose to the normal structures in the brain adjacent to the tumor. All of the radiation treatment techniques presently available deliver 10-50% of prescribed dose to the normal brain. Intraoperative irradiation using PRS because of its direct application into the tumor or tumor bed limits the dose to the normal tissue. This approach could result in a significant decrease in radiation induced complications in vital structures such as the optic pathway, brain stem and cerebral blood vessels. Another advantage of PRS is that unlike other types of therapy, the PRS does not require the use of a radiation-shielded room. To summarize, the advantages of the interstitial/surface application of radiation using the PRS are:  Direct access to the surgical bed of the tumor Accurate delivery of a high single dose of radiation to the tumor Superior protection of adjacent brain, cranial nerves or other critical structures by the use of intraoperative shielding or intraoperative displacement of these organs Superior radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) of low energy X-rays Tumor dose inhomogeneity similar to brachytherapy and Gamma knife radiosurgery, with the center of the tumor receiving a higher dose than the peripheral region that is adjacent to normal structures.  Results of studies carried out with the PRS in brain tumors have demonstrated it to be capable of delivering a lethal dose of radiation, in a single application to intracranial tumors with minimal side effects. It has been used to treat primary and metastatic brain tumors. In a report from Massachusetts General Hospital, 14 adults with primary and metastatic brain tumors < 3.5 cm in greatest diameter were treated with a single fraction of irradiation using PRS. The treated tumor diameter ranged from 10mm - 35 mm (mean 21mm), and the tumor edge prescribed dose ranged from 10-20 Gy (average 12.5 Gy). The average treatment time was 23 minutes (range, 7-45 minutes). Local control was obtained in 10 of the 13 patients with a follow-up of 1.5 - 36 months (mean 12 months). All patients tolerated the procedure well, and most patients were discharged home the day after treatment. No new neurological deficits were noted after irradiation. This study aims at determining the maximum tolerated dose of irradiation using PRS in recurrent pediatric brain tumors.  Dose Selection  The radiation dose delivered by the PRS and radiosurgery are similar with regard to dose-rate and total dose. The RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) has performed a dose escalation study to assess the maximum tolerated dose of radiosurgery in adults with previously irradiated brain tumors and brain metastases. Based on acute and late toxicity, the maximum tolerated radiosurgery doses were 24 Gy, 18 Gy and 15 Gy for tumors < 20 mm, 21-30 mm and 31-40 mm respectively.  In this study we had intended to perform a similar dose escalation study with doses ranging from 10-19 Gy, 10-16 Gy and 10 - 14 Gy for tumors < 20 mm, 21-25 mm and 26-40 mm respectively. These doses are lower than the established maximum tolerated doses for brain reirradiation in adults with radiosurgery. These doses are also lower than the 20-40 Gy doses utilized for intraoperative irradiation of adult brain tumors with electrons and Cobalt 60 sources.  An interim analysis of patients entered on the study was performed. Based on the occurrence of treatment -related complications in ONE patient who required 2 applicators and in another patient in whom the dose was prescribed to 5 mm depth, the protocol has been modified as follows:  No patient will have PRS treatment using more than one applicator The depth of prescribed dose should not exceed 2 mm Patients who have received prior RT and those who have not received prior RT would be classified into Group A and Group B respectively. The dose levels will for these two groups would be as shown in the table in Section 8.0. The dose escalation for non-brainstem (10-19 Gy) remains the same, but dose escalation will no longer be stratified by tumor size. The dose levels for sites adjacent to the brainstem and/or cranial nerves (10-14 Gy) also remain the same. A minimum of 3 patients will have to be accrued in each dose level and only if there are no complications observed, accrual at the next dose level would begin.  Dose escalation will be based on the incidence of acute CNS toxicity defined by RTOG criteria. Unacceptable toxicity will be considered to be irreversible grade 3 (severe), any grade 4 (life threatening) or grade 5 (fatal) RTOG CNS toxicity occurring within 3 months of reirradiation. If no patient developed an unacceptable CNS toxicity as defined below, the dose for that tumor size was then escalated.  The brain stem is very important part of the brain that controls most bodily functions like blood pressure, respiration etc. In this study, we have adopted a gentler dose escalation scheme for tumors in and around the brain stem. The three doses to be studied for tumors in this location are10 Gy, 12 Gy and 14 Gy. These doses will be delivered independent of tumor size."

416,Dietary Methionine Restriction Plus Temozolomide for Recurrent GBM,NCT00508456,"Methionine is an essential amino acid. Many solid tumors depend on the methionine that is taken in through the diet. The tumors need methionine to grow. A methionine free (or reduced) diet may help to shrink or slow the growth of some tumors. Temozolomide is a drug that is commonly used in the treatment of glioma. A methionine free (or reduced) diet may increase the effectiveness of temozolomide in the treatment of glioma.  Before treatment, you will have a complete physical exam and blood (around 2 tablespoons) will be collected for routine tests. You will have either a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test. You will then meet with a study dietician. The dietician will give you written instructions and make a food plan based on your needs. The instructions and food plan will help you maintain a methionine-free (or reduced) diet during the study.  During the study, all participants will receive standard chemotherapy with temozolomide by mouth once a day at bedtime for 7 days on Days 8 through 14 and 22 through 28, every 28 days, 4 weeks This 4-week period is called a cycle of chemotherapy. This 4 week cycle will be repeated as long as the disease does not get worse.  During treatment, you will be asked to maintain a methionine free diet during Days 1 - 7 and Days 15 - 21. During the periods of methionine free diet, you will consume only ""shakes"" containing Hominex-2?. The Hominex-2? shakes are nutritionally complete and easy to prepare. You will be given instructions on how to maintain this methionine-free diet.  All participants enrolled in the study will consume a methionine free diet for 1 week, alternating with temozolomide chemotherapy for 1 week. The participants will then be switched to a methionine ""replete"" diet for 1 week while taking chemotherapy. This diet and chemotherapy schedule will be continued for as long as the treatment is effective and tolerable. This replete diet contains methionine. The dietician will record what you eat to make sure you are eating the right amount of methionine during this period. This 4-week schedule will be repeated as long as you are on the study.  If you experience any intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse, you will be taken off the study and your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.  During treatment, you will have blood (around 1 tablespoon) collected every 2 weeks for routine tests. Every 4 weeks for the first 16 weeks then every 8 weeks for the rest of the study, you will have check up visits. At these visits, you will have a complete physical exam and have blood collected (around 1 tablespoon) for routine tests. You will also have a dietary consultation. Every 8 weeks during the study, you will have either a MRI scan or a CT scan of the brain. If your doctor feels it is necessary, the tests may be done more often or you may have other tests as needed for your care.  This is an investigational study. Methionine restriction diet (Hominex?-2 Amino Acid-Modified Medical Food) has been approved by the FDA for nutrition support of children and adults with vitamin B6-nonresponsive homocystinuria. However, its use in this study is investigational. Temozolomide has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of brain tumors and is commercially available. The use of this combination is experimental. Forty-four participants will take part in this study."

Before treatment starts, patients will have a complete exam, including measurement of height and weight. Blood tests (less than 2 tablespoons of blood) will be performed. A MRI scan will be done. Women who are able have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.  Temozolomide and R115777 will both be taken by mouth. Participants in this study will take temozolomide once a day for 7 days every other week (Days 1-7 and 15-21). This will be repeated every 28 days (1 course). Patients must not eat for 1 hour before and after taking the drug; drinking water is allowed. All treatment may be given on an outpatient basis.  During the alternate weeks (Days 8-14 and 22-28), participants will take R115777 tablets by mouth in the morning and evening with food. At the beginning of the study, groups of 3 participants each will take increasing doses of both R115777 and temozolomide until the highest safe dose of each drug, when given in combination, is found. Participants entering the study after the highest safe dose is found will receive that dosage.  If tumors do not grow and serious side effects do not occur, participants may keep on taking temozolomide and R115777 for up to 2 year. If your physician thinks it is advisable, treatment may continue with R115777 alone after that time. In this case, routine blood tests for counts, liver and kidney function (less than 2 tablespoons) will be repeated every 4 weeks and MRI scans, physical, and neurological exams will be done every 8 weeks. Participants may not receive any other treatment for cancer (including surgery) while taking part in this study.  Participants will come to the clinic to have a complete physical and neurological exam and blood tests (less than 2 tablespoons of blood) before each course.

426,Phase IIa Safety and Light Dose-escalation Study in Patients With Primary or Recurrent/High-grade Glioma Using the Litx¢â System to Confirm the Zone of Tumor Destruction During the Intraoperative Treatment of Glioma,NCT00409214,"Light Infusion Technology (Litx¢â) is a locoregional cancer treatment in which a systemically administered light-activated drug (LS11) is activated locally by illuminating the diseased tissue using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of a specific wavelength. The activated photosensitizer reacts with endogenous oxygen to yield highly reactive species of oxygen that cause destruction of cellular structures such as mitochondria, lysosomes and cell walls leading to irreversible cell damage and tissue death.  Either twenty-four or twelve hours prior to surgery, the patient will receive an intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg of LS11, given IV by slow push over 3-5 minutes.  Following craniotomy, patients will undergo intraoperative placement of a single Light Source, centrally placed within the tumor, under direct visualization prior to tumor resection. Following placement of the light source (with the depth of the end of the light bar from the cortical surface to be calculated from the pre-operative MRI and spiral CT scan, so as to be centralized within the main tumor bulk), light will be delivered following a predetermined escalation schedule (either 100 J/cm or 200 J/cm) at 20 mW/cm light energy for a treatment time of 1 hour 24 minutes (100J/cm) or 2 hours 46 minutes (200 J/cm). The Light Source will then be manually removed and the tumor maximally resected.  The resected tumor and marginal tissue will be submitted for pathology to determine depth of cell death, extent of tumor tissue containing closed vessels, any evidence of vessel closure or other damage to tissues outside of the projected kill zone."

428,"6-TG, Capecitabine and Celecoxib Plus TMZ or CCNU for Anaplastic Glioma Patients",NCT00504660,"Capecitabine is a drug that damages the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of tumor cells and blocks the function of DNA and RNA (ribonucleic acid) of tumor cells. These actions help to kill the tumor cells.  Celecoxib is a drug that may help to prevent the development of some types of cancer by blocking a type of enzyme (COX-2) that is found in tumor cells.  Temozolomide and CCNU are the current standard treatment for malignant brain tumors. Both drugs work by damaging the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of tumor cells to kill these tumor cells.  6-Thioguanine is a drug that helps to increase the effects of Temozolomide and CCNU on tumor cells.  Depending on the previous treatment you have received, you will be treated according to Arms 1, 2, or 3.  If you have not received temozolomide before, you will be treated on Arm 1. If you have received temozolomide before but only during radiation therapy and not as chemotherapy afterwards and the treatment was over 6 months ago, you will be treated with temozolomide according to Arm 1.  If you have not received lomustine or carmustine, you will be treated on Arm 2. If you have received Gliadel wafers at surgery greater than 6 months ago and have not been treated with lomustine or carmustine, you will be treated with CCNU according to Arm 2.  Arm 3 will include glioblastoma multiforme patients who may be treated with either temozolomide or lomustine according to the above guidelines and regimens described in Arms 1 and 2.

431,A Phase 2 Evaluation of TRC105 In Combination With Bevacizumab in Patients With Glioblastoma,NCT01564914,"Angiogenesis plays a central role in the progression of solid cancer. TRC105 is an antibody to CD105, an important non-VEGF angiogenic target on proliferating endothelial cells. TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models. TRC105 has been well tolerated in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) as a single agent. The combination of TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab has demonstrated activity in bevacizumab refractory cancer patients. We hypothesize that TRC105 when administered with bevacizumab will have activity in GBM patients who progress on bevacizumab. By targeting a non-VEGF pathway, TRC105 has the potential to complement VEGF inhibition by bevacizumab, which could represent a major advance in GBM therapy."
432,Phase I-II Everolimus and Sorafenib in Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas,NCT01434602,"Background  Although malignant gliomas display genetic heterogeneity, several key proliferation and survival signaling pathways have been identified. Recent work has focused on targeting these tumor specific pathways in hopes of improving treatment efficacy and minimizing treatment toxicity. Because molecularly targeted agents have been mostly ineffective when used alone, combination therapy that inhibits multiple pathways is an appealing strategy. Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Although most GBMs lack RAF mutations, targeting the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may be beneficial as this pathway may be activated by other genetic alterations upstream from RAF. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a downstream component of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Everolimus (everolimus; Novartis) is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin. Combining everolimus and sorafenib allows targeting of both the PI3K pathway and the RAF-MAPK pathway and in addition targets VEGF and PDGF, other active targets in malignant glioma.  Objectives  Phase 1  -To determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of everolimus in combination with  sorafenib for patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.  Phase 2  6 month progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study. 3 month progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with prior bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study. 6 month progression free survival rate for AG patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study.  Eligibility  Patients with histologically proven recurrent intracranial malignant glioma will be eligible for the phase I/II component of this protocol. Patients must be >= 18 years old with a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60 No more than 2 prior chemotherapies and 1 relapse. Prior bevacizumab therapy is allowed.  Design  This is a phase 1 /2 study of everolimus and sorafenib in patients with recurrent highgrade gliomas. Phase 1: Patients will be treated with daily everolimus (days 1-28) in combination with sorafenib. Phase 2: Patients will be treated with the combination of sorafenib and everolimus. Sorafenib will be taken daily for 7 days on, then 7 days off. Everolimus will be taken daily. There is not a defined set maximum number of cycles that a patient may have. Patients may continue with protocol therapy until criteria for Off Treatment is met. Patients will then be followed every 3 months for survival status. There will be an accrual of approximately 3-6 eligible patients per cohort to the Phase I component of the study. Patients removed at any time for toxicity are evaluable. Phase I patients removed from study treatment within 28 days for reasons other than toxicity may be replaced. There will be a total accrual of approximately 82 eligible patients to the Phase II study (34 recurrent GBM with no prior exposure to bevacizumab, 16 recurrent Anaplastic Glioma with no prior exposure to bevacizumab, and 32 glioblastoma with prior exposure to bevacizumab)."

434,GW572016 to Treat Recurrent Malignant Brain Tumors,NCT00107003,"Background:  - One of the most critical challenges facing glioblastoma translational research is developing ways to predict, based on a patient's biopsy, which targeted inhibitor is most likely to provide benefit. The studies outlined in this proposal are designed to determine which glioblastoma patients are most likely to benefit from GW572106, and may provide a blueprint for analyzing promising new pathway inhibitors in the future. We anticipate that these studies will serve as the basis for biological endpoint based trials in the future. Thus, the overall goal is to evaluate the efficacy of GW572016 in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas in patients who are candidates for re-resection.  Objective:  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate for patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma treated with GW572016. Determine whether GW572016 inhibits the phosphorylation of its cellular targets EGFR and HER2, and the downstream PI3K-AKT and RAS-ERK signaling pathways in glioblastoma patients in vivo. Determine tumor concentrations of GW572016. Assess overall progression free survival and safety.  Eligibility:  Patients with histologically proven intracranial tumors to include only glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and Gliosarcoma (GS). Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a GBM is made. Patients must be candidates for surgical re-resection (total, or sub-total) in order to be eligible for this study. Following surgery, a scan should be done no later than 96 hours Patients may be on a non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (Non-EIAED's). They may not be on EIAED's. If previously on an EIAED, patient must be off of it for two weeks prior to initiation of pre-operative drug.  Design:  A Pre-Treatment blood sample (10ml) will be obtained in all patients for genotyping Pre- Operative: GW572016 will be administered at a starting dose of 750 mg orally BID daily on an outpatient basis for 7-10 days. (This range is to allow flexibility for planning surgery). GW572016 will be continued up to and including the evening before surgery. At the time of surgery 10ml of blood will be collected in EDTA containing tubes for pharmacodynamic analysis Treatment may be instituted postoperatively as soon as patients have recovered from effects of surgery and demonstrated wound healing. Treatment with GW572016 post-operatively should start no later than 28 days after surgery. GW572016 will be administered at a starting dose of 750 mg orally BID daily on an outpatient basis. GW572016 will be administered continuously; however, for the purposes of protocol evaluations, a cycle will be defined as 28 days."

436,Efficacy and Safety of G-202 in PSMA-Positive Glioblastoma,NCT02876003,"Glioblastoma (GBM) comprises about 16% of all malignancies of the nervous system and over 50% of all gliomas. Standard of care for newly-diagnosed GBM is a combination of surgical debulking followed by concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Efforts to improve second-line therapy in GBM have met with only marginal success and there is a large unmet medical need for new therapies. G-202 (mipsagargin) is an example of prodrug chemotherapy. It is activated by Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), which is expressed by some cancer cells and in the blood vessels of most solid tumors, including GBM, but not by normal cells or blood vessels in normal tissue. It is believed that activation of the prodrug G-202 will allow the drug to kill cancer cells. This study will evaluate the activity, safety and CNS exposure of G-202 in patients with PSMA-positive recurrent or progressive GMB receiving G-202 by intravenous infusion on three consecutive days of a 28-day cycle."
437,Oral Tarceva Study for Recurrent/Residual Glioblastoma Multiforme and Anaplastic Astrocytoma,NCT00301418,"The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA, from initial diagnosis, despite multimodal treatment approaches. Initial therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. The role of adjuvant or concomitant chemotherapy in the initial therapy of GBM and AA has not, as yet, been clearly defined. Since most of these patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. In August 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan drug status for Erlotinib in patients with malignant glioma. Erlotinib (OSI-774) has been shown to be active in a range of tumors including GBM, AA and non small cell lung cancer. Because of the promising results in preliminary studies of Erlotinib and because of significant experience with the safety of the dosages proposed in this study, this study will offer a safe adjuvant treatment for patients with relapsing recurring glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma. Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial will test the hypothesis that Erlotinib can be safely used up to a dose of 150 mg bid for 12 cycles to ultimately enhance survival of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM/AA with particular genetic alterations including EGFRvIII amplification and PTEN loss."

448,Bevacizumab and Nimustine in Patients With Recurrent High Grade Glioma,NCT02698280,"Although anti-angiogenesis therapy for glioblastoma(GBM) are showing promise, GBMs often develop resistance to treatment within months or weeks after salvage therapy. There are still no effective markers to predict the response rate to bevacizumab.  So the investigators initiate a single-arm Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of bevacizumab and nimustine regimen and to explore the predictive markers in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma."
449,LITT Followed by Hypofractionated RT for Recurrent Gliomas,NCT04181684,"Radiation therapy is preferably used as an adjunct to surgery for patients with a newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma. LITT offers an alternative to surgical resection, and due to its minimally invasive nature, does not delay initiating radiation therapy. Another advantage of LITT prior to radiation therapy is the ability to obtain a tissue diagnosis of recurrent tumor prior to initiating radiation therapy."

451,Ph I Zactima + Imatinib Mesylate & Hydroxyurea for Pts w Recurrent Malignant Glioma,NCT00613054,"vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) angiogenic & Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/AKT) mitogenic cascades are 2 upregulated cell signalling pathways in MG that contribute to several hallmark phenotypic features of these tumors. Regimen of Zactima + imatinib mesylate represents novel anti-glioma strategy because it targets 3 key mediators of dysregulated cell signalling involving VEGF & PI3K-AKT pathways including VEGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) & platelet derived growth factor(PDGFR). Furthermore by combining Zactima w imatinib mesylate, VEGF & PI3-k/AKT pathways can potentially inhibit multiple mediators of each of these pathways. Regarding PI3-K/AKT signalling, regimen can inhibit activation of EGFR & PDGFR. Regarding VEGF signalling, regimen has potential to inhibit 3 components of VEGFR directed angiogenesis. 1st, Zactima can directly inhibit VEGFR activation. 2nd, both Zactima & imatinib mesylate can indirectly decrease activity of VEGF pathway by diminishing positive input from activated PI3-K/AKT signalling. 3rd, imatinib mesylate may inhibit PDGF-regulated pericyte maturation of tumor blood vessels.  We have previously demonstrated that regimen of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea is active regimen among recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) pts. Furthermore this activity appears substantially better than that reported for imatinib mesylate alone. Although mechanism of enhanced activity for imatinib mesylate when combo w hydroxyurea is unclear, it is logical to build upon combo of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea in subsequent studies rather than imatinib mesylate alone. Current study will therefore determine MTD of Zactima when combo w standard doses of imatinib mesylate & hydroxyurea among RMG pts. Ph II study will then be performed, incorporating maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Zactima + imatinib mesylate in order to evaluate anti-glioma potential of regimen."

458,Phase IIb Clinical Trial With TGF-¥â2 Antisense Compound AP 12009 for Recurrent or Refractory High-grade Glioma,NCT00431561,"The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of two doses of AP 12009 and standard chemotherapy in adult patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma [AA], WHO grade III; or glioblastoma [GBM], WHO grade IV). AP 12009 is a phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide specific for the mRNA of human transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2). The growth factor TGF-beta plays a key role in malignant progression of various tumors by inducing proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and escape from immunosurveillance. It has been shown that in a number of tumor types the degree of TGF-beta production strongly correlates with tumor grade and stage. In patients with high-grade glioma, the TGF-beta2 overexpression is associated with disease stage, clinical prognosis and the immunodeficient state of the patients."

469,Bevacizumab and Ascorbic Acid in Patients Treating With Recurrent High Grade Glioma,NCT02833701,"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:  I. To evaluate the toxicities and determine the recommended dose of intravenous ascorbic acid given three times weekly in combination with intravenous bevacizumab every two weeks in patients with recurrent high grade glioma.  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:  I. To evaluate changes in the levels of serum ascorbic acid (using high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] with coulometric electrochemical detection) during therapy with ascorbic acid and bevacizumab.  II. Radiographic assessment of disease status after 2 cycles of therapy with ascorbic acid and bevacizumab.  III. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival of patients with recurrent high grade glioma treated with therapy with ascorbic acid and bevacizumab. Patients with stable or responsive disease after every 2 cycles will continue on therapy with ascorbic acid and bevacizumab until intolerance or progressive disease.  IV. To descriptively examine quality of life (QOL) using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire QLQ-C30 during treatment.  OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ascorbic acid.  Patients receive ascorbic acid intravenously (IV) over 90-120 minutes three times per week (at least 24 hours apart) and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year."
470,Phase I/II Trial of Safety and Anti-tumor Efficacy of AXL1717(Picropodophyllin) in the Treatment of Recurrent Malignant Astrocytomas,NCT01721577,"AXL1717, as a ready-to-use suspension of picropodophyllin for oral administration, will be distributed in bottles for single use at a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Fixed doses will be used, i.e. there are no adjustments for weight or body surface. There will be no randomization or blinding in the study.  The trial will be divided in two phases. In the first phase, 10-20 patients will be enrolled and treated with 300-520 mg BID of AXL1717 for 28 days. The primary endpoint of the first phase is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AXL1717 in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma and to assess the safety and toxicity of AXL1717 in this patient population. The study has a 3+3 design and the first cohort will be treated with 400 mg AXL1717 BID for 28 days repeated in up to 5 cycles. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) such as neutropenia occurs, dosing will be interrupted and the individual patient will, following normalization, be restarted on the same or a lower dose level according to standardized procedure. If two or three of the first 3 patients on a specific dose level experience a DLT during the first 28 days of treatment with AXL1717, the following patients will be treated with a lower dose level. If one DLT occurs during the first 28 days of dosing in the first 3 three patients another 3 patients will be treated with the same dose level. If 2 of the 6 patients display DLT, the next patients will be treated with a lower dose level. The highest dose level without DLT or with maximally one DLT out of 6 patients will be the RPTD. All assessments with respect to dose adjustments for subsequent cohorts will be done during the first 28 days of treatment. Non-progressing patients may be treated for a total of five 28-day cycles (24 weeks).  In the second phase, 12 patients will be enrolled and treated with the identified RP2D of AXL1717 for 28 days repeated in five cycles. The primary endpoints of phase II is to assess the proportion of patients who are progression-free at 24 weeks and to assess safety, tolerability, and adverse event profile of AXL1717."
471,ADV-TK Improves Outcome of Recurrent High-Grade Glioma,NCT00870181,"Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, but the prognosis for patients with these tumors remains poor despite advances in diagnosis and standard therapies such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The advantages of ADV-TK gene therapy highlight its efficacy and safety for glioma patients. This clinical trial was conducted to assess the anti-tumor efficacy and safety of intraarterial cerebral infusion of replication-deficient adenovirus mutant ADV-TK, in combination with systemic intravenous GCV administration in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma."
472,Dose-Escalation Study of Carboplatin Administration Into the Brain for Glioblastoma Multiforme,NCT01317212,"High-grade gliomas are the commonest primary malignant brain tumours in adults, affecting approximately 5000 people per year in the UK. Standard treatment comprises a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy; however this condition remains incurable and the average survival is approximately 18 months from diagnosis. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly these tumours are highly invasive and involve important areas of brain making it impossible to remove them surgically or cure them with radiotherapy. In the majority of cases the tumour recurs within 2 to 3cm of the original site of tumour removal. Secondly, due to the presence of a barrier between the bloodstream and the brain, when drugs designed to kill tumour cells (chemotherapy) are given intravenously or orally, they frequently do not reach the tumour at a sufficient dose to have a beneficial effect. As the chemotherapy dose has to be very high for a sufficient dose to reach the tumour, drug-related side-effects are common.  Laboratory studies demonstrate that glioma tumour cells are sensitive to a number of different chemotherapies, including carboplatin. When given intravenously however, carboplatin does not reach a sufficient concentration in the tumour to have a beneficial effect. However, studies have shown that carboplatin can be infused directly into the brain at a concentration that is highly toxic to tumour cells, but not to normal brain tissue. Using very small tubes implanted around the tumour, the investigators are able to infuse carboplatin reliably and repeatedly into the area where tumours typical recur. In this study, the investigators intend to evaluate the safety of this approach and determine the optimal dose of carboplatin to administer. It is hoped that this study will also provide evidence of improved survival for patients with high-grade glioma."
473,Bevacizumab for Recurrent Malignant Glioma,NCT00271609,"Background  In vivo experiments have documented the ability of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies like bevacizumab to inhibit tumor growth in various preclinical tumor models, including gliomas. Given the pronounced neovasculature associated with over-expression of VEGF in malignant gliomas, and abundant published data demonstrating the dependence of glioma growth on the maintenance and proliferation of this neovasculature, bevacizumab represents a potentially promising new therapeutic approach to these otherwise refractory tumors.  Objective  To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas as determined by progression-free-survival. To obtain information regarding the safety of bevacizumab administered to patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.  Eligibility  Adult patients with histologically proven intracranial malignant glioma Patients must have evidence for tumor progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan Patients must have progressed after radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater than or equal to 4 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry  Design  Patients will be treated with bevacizumab by intravenous injection at a dose of 10mg/kg every two weeks on a 4-week cycle. Prior to the first dose of bevacizumab and at the completion of the first 4-weeks of treatment, patients will undergo a fludeoxyglucose 18F -positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan (in cycle one only and then as needed) and a MRI perfusion scan. Peripheral blood circulating endothelial progenitor cells will be collected at the time of each MRI-perfusion scan. Additionally, patients will undergo a MRI perfusion scan within 48-96 hours of their first dose of bevacizumab (in cycle one only). For patients who are clinically/neurologically stable and with stable or responding radiographic disease at the end of each treatment cycle, treatment will continue with bevacizumab every 2 weeks, repeating MRI-perfusion scans at the conclusion (e.g. prior to another administration of bevacizumab) of each 4 week cycle.  A total of 88 patients will be enrolled on this study."
474,Sunitinib to Treat Recurrent Brain Cancer,NCT00923117,"Background:  Solid tumors have multiple mechanisms for stimulating angiogenesis with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) axis being only one of them. Sunitinib, through its multiple tyrosine kinase receptor targets, represents an attempt to capitalize on the concept of targeting multiple mechanisms responsible for glioma-associated angiogenesis. Sunitinib inhibits platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-kit (stem cell factor (SCF) receptor) at nanomolar concentrations. The combination blocks all three known major glioma-mediated angiogenic mechanisms (VEGF, c-kit, PDGF). Based on this scientific rationale, the promising anti-glioma activity of sunitinib in preclinical models, and the promising clinical data in patients with gliomas treated with other VEGF inhibitors, we are now proposing a phase II trial of sunitinib in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.  Objectives:  To evaluate the anti-glioma activity of sunitinib in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas who are either naive or resistant to prior bevacizumab therapy.  Eligibility:  Patients with recurrent malignant glioma are eligible for this study.  Design:  This is a phase II study with a target enrollment of 64 (32 with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 32 with anaplastic glioma (AG)) patients who have not progressed on prior treatment with anti-VEGF therapy, and 64 (32 with GBM and 32 with AG)patients who have progressed on prior bevacizumab therapy.  Sunitinib will be self-administered orally at 37.5 mg daily, with dose adjustments allowed for toxicity and concomitant drug interactions.  The primary endpoint is six-month progression free survival for both arms of the study.  We performed an interim analysis (see below) and after consulting with the pharmaceutical company (Pfizer) we believe that ending the study is the most appropriate course of action to take.  In the original design of the trial, for the AG stratum, the agent will be considered effective if at least 14 patients have not progressed by 6 months. Now, we have observed one out 10 Bev-na?ve who haven't progressed by 6 months. Then given one patient in the first 10 patients whose PFS >=6, the conditional probability of observing at least 14 out of 32 patients who are 6 month-PFS is only 43% even if the true 6 months-PFS is 55%. Since in the first 10 patients, we only observed one patient with PFS>=6 months, it is unlikely that the true 6 month-PFS is 55%. The conditional power would be close to zero, if the true 6 month-PFS close to 10% as observed so far. Based on the conditional probability, the chance of a positive study is small, and hence the trial should be considered stopped for futility.  For Bev-resistant patients, because in the first 12 patients none had PFS >= 6 months the conditional probability of declaring the agent being effective is even lower and equals 12%, if the true PFS at 6 months is 55%. Essentially there is little chance that the agent can be declared effective."

477,A Phase 0 Study of AZD1775 in Recurrent GBM Patients,NCT02207010,"Patients will be administered one dose of AZD1775 prior to surgical resection of their tumor. There will be 2 portions of this trial, referred to as Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 will involve a dose escalation strategy where 3 separate doses (100, 200, and 400mg) will be evaluated. Each dose cohort will involve 4 patients. Surgery, with tissue harvest for determination of both tissue drug level and biomarker evaluation, will occur at 8 hrs post drug administration.  Part 2 will determine the potential tumor drug level and PD effects at various time intervals after drug administration of a single select drug dose. Currently, we are planning to use a dose (200 mg) that has been deemed safe when used in combination with cytotoxic therapy. However, if results from Part 1 suggest an alternate dose may be preferable, we will consider using that alternate dose in Part 2. Dosing will be followed by surgical resection at 2-4 hrs and at 22-26 hrs post dose."

480,Phase II Trial of Peginterferon Alpha-2b and Thalidomide in Adults With Recurrent Gliomas,NCT00047879,"Background:  There is a growing belief that angiogenesis inhibition represents a potentially promising, novel therapeutic approach to highly vascular solid tumors like malignant gliomas. Thalidomide and Peg-Intron (IFN - Interferon) are attractive drugs to use in combination to test the hypothesis of combination anti-angiogenesis therapy inhibition given their proven activity as single agents in patients with malignant gliomas and their spectrum of largely non-overlapping toxicities.  Given recent preclinical data describing more potent antiangiogenic and anti-tumor effects of low dose, continuous IFN administration, we are interested in evaluating the use of pegylated IFN in combination with thalidomide. Thus, we are proposing a phase II trial of pegylated IFN with thalidomide in patients with recurrent gliomas.  Objectives:  To obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy of PEG-Intron in combination with thalidomide in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas as assessed by prolongation of progression-free survival compared to historical controls.  A secondary endpoint in this trial is to determine the response rate associated with the combination therapy in each of the two strata and to evaluate and document all toxicities from PEG-Intron in combination with thalidomide at the doses prescribed in this protocol in this patient population.  Eligibility:  Patients with histologically proven supratentorial malignant primary gliomas will be eligible for this protocol. These include glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant astrocytoma NOS (not otherwise specified).  Patients must not have received prior therapy with Peg-Intron or Thalidomide.  Design:  Patients will be treated with weekly PEG-Intron plus daily oral thalidomide. All patients will be treated for 6 weeks following which patients will have a repeat MRI scan to assess disease response."

482,A Study of the Treatment of Recurrent Malignant Glioma With rQNestin34.5v.2,NCT03152318,"This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug as a possible treatment for this diagnosis. ""Investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied.  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved rQNestin34.5v.2 as a treatment for any disease. This is the first time that rQnestin34.5v.2 will be given to humans.  The research drug, rQNestin34.5v.2, is an oncolytic viral vector made from the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). The large majority of humans already have regular HSV1 in their nervous system. Normally, this virus can cause cold sores in areas like the lips, fingers and genitals in humans by making copies of itself in normal healthy cells. In some cases, HSV1 can cause severe infection of the brain and liver and/or death. However, scientists have removed or changed parts of the rQNestin virus being used on this study so it can only make copies of itself in glioma cells and not normal healthy cells.  If it is effective, the rQNestin34.5v.2 drug will spread to a glioma cell, kill it, and then make a copy of itself and spread again. This should be repeated over and over until all glioma cells are reached. If rQNestin34.5v.2 moves into a normal brain cell, it should not grow and make copies, and therefore should not spread to other normal brain cells.  The purpose of this research study is to test if rQnestin34.5v.2 is safe to use in humans, and if it is effective in treating malignant glioma. This study is also looking for the highest dose of rQNestin34.5v.2 that can be given safely to people with malignant brain tumors."

489,Tamoxifen and Bortezomib to Treat Recurrent Brain Tumors,NCT00108069,"Background:  Tamoxifen (TAM), a member of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) family, is widely used in the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER) expressing breast cancer. It has previously been shown that high-dose TAM has cytotoxic activity against glioma cells, but whether this effect is drug-specific or represents a general property of SERMs was unknown. We have now demonstrated that suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation markedly enhances SERM-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role for NF-kB in protecting glioma cells from SERM-induced cytotoxicity.  Bortezomib is a potent inhibitor of the 26S proteosome and causes significant anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects in a number of cell lines through its protean effects on a variety of cellular signaling pathways, including its ability to potently inhibit the NF-kB pathway. We have recently demonstrated that bortezomib has significant anti-glioma activity in vitro and a ongoing clinical trial has demonstrated some possible activity in patients with recurrent gliomas. We have now also generated preclinical data demonstrating that bortezomib in combination with Tamoxifen has synergistic cytotoxic effects on glioma cells.  Thus, given the minimal to modest activity of both drugs in patients with recurrent gliomas, given their spectrum of non-overlapping toxicities, and given the marked synergistic glioma cell killing of the combination of drugs in our preclinical screens, we are now proposing a phase II trial of bortezomib in combination with Tamoxifen in patients with recurrent gliomas not taking enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs).  Objectives:  The primary statistical endpoint will be response (defined as either stable disease or objective response as is standard in neuro-oncology clinical trials) after 6 weeks of treatment.  Eligibility:  Patients with histologically proven high-grade gliomas or patients with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of brainstem glioma will be eligible for this protocol.  Design:  The phase II study will be stratified by the type of high grade glioma (anaplastic glioma (AA) or glioblastoma (GBM)) and a two-stage min-max design with a maximum of 41 patients in the GBM stratum and 36 patients in the AA stratum."

Preclinical studies in our laboratory and others have shown potent antiglioma activity in vivo and early clinical trials of bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan and alone (National Institutes of Health (NIH) study) have demonstrated significant anti-vascular permeability and anti-glioma effects in patients with recurrent gliomas.  Tandutinib (MLN518) along with bevacizumab represents an attempt to further capitalize on the concept of targeting the tumor vasculature. Tandutinib is a small molecule inhibitor of fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and cKIT (type III receptor tyrosine kinases). It has demonstrated anti-leukemic activity in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose blasts contain an activating internal tandem duplication mutation of FLT3. However, in this study tandutinib is being added to bevacizumab primarily for its activity against the PDGFR and cKIT. Hannahan and colleagues have demonstrated the additional anti-tumor activity that results in vivo with combined inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and PDGFR. The activity of PDGFR inhibition is hypothesized to result from its effect on pericytes, the cells that surround and support endothelial cells. These cells have abundant expression of PDGFR and require platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-PDGFR interaction for their normal function.  Objectives  To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of the combination of bevacizumab and tandutinib in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, as determined by progression-free-survival.  Eligibility  Patients with histologically proven recurrent malignant glioma are eligible for this study.  Design  Patients will receive tandutinib as a single agent at a daily dose of 500 mg PO bid for the first 14 days of treatment. Radiology: Prior to the first dose of tandutinib patients will undergo an MRI-perfusion scan and an FDG-PET scan. An MRI-perfusion scan will then be repeated between days 12-14 of the first 14 days of tandutinib monotherapy. On day 15, treatment with bevacizumab will be added to the ongoing treatment with tandutinib. Bevacizumab will be given intravenously in a dose of 10 mg/kg, repeated once every 2 weeks. After completion of the first 4 weeks of combined tandutinib and bevacizumab therapy (6 weeks after initiating treatment with tandutinib) considered the first cycle of therapy) the MRI-perfusion and fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans will be repeated before the next dose of bevacizumab is given. Patients who are clinically/neurologically stable, and who have radiographically stable or responding disease at the end of that first cycle and every cycle thereafter (every 4 weeks), will continue treatment with tandutinib and bevacizumab. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-perfusion scans will be repeated after the completion of every 4 weeks of therapy. A total of 80 patients will be enrolled to this study (GBM (glioblastoma multiforme)=40, AG=40)"
491,Study of Icapamespib (PU-AD) in Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma,NCT04782609,"This is a 2-part multicenter Phase 1b study designed to test the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single agent oral icapamespib in patients with recurrent brain lesions.  Part 1 of the trial will be a standard 3 by 3 dose escalation design where different doses are examined. Part 2 will be a dose expansion cohort to further evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The RP2D is defined as the dose level recommended for further clinical study, or the highest dose tested. The RP2D may be the same as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or modified from the MTD based on assessment of overall exposure, safety experience in Cycle 2 and beyond, and clinical benefit data in the study. The RP2D will be determined in the dose expansion phase of the study.  Part 1: Up to 30 patients with 1st, 2nd or 3rd recurrence of IDH wild type glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or grade 3 or 4, Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant astrocytoma will be enrolled to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and MTD of single agent oral icapamespib administered daily.  Icapamespib will be administered orally once daily for each 28-day cycle. The initial dose in this trial will be 20 mg in Cohort 1. Dose escalation will proceed as follows:  100% increment until the first drug-related Grade 2 adverse event (AE) occurs, then 50% increment until the first drug-related Grade 3 event occurs, then 33% increment until the first Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) occurs, then 20% increment until RP2D is declared."
492,"Dietary, Herbal and Alternative Medicine in Glioblastoma Multiforme",NCT00243022,"OBJECTIVES:  Primary  To determine whether a herbal approach to decreasing 5-LO eicosanoid production reduces peritumoral brain edema in patients with HGG.  Secondary  To determine if this adjuvant approach improves the quality of life and progression free and overall survival of patients with HGG.  OUTLINE: This a randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.  Arm I (intervention): Patients receive oral Boswellia serrata herbal extract 4 times a day and oral cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) once a day for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Arm II (control): Patients receive oral vitamin B-12 once a day for 6 months. All patients are encouraged to eat a regular balanced diet (as recommended by the American Cancer Society for cancer prevention) with limited consumption of red and processed meats.  Quality of life will be assessed at baseline and then at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months.  After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed every 6 months.  PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients (35 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study."
493,Tamoxifen Versus Lomustine After First Recurrence in GBM Patients,NCT04765098,"The treatment of recurrence in GBM remains controversial and there is no evidence-informed standard second-line therapy. Generally worldwide, lomustine is the most commonly used agent at first progression despite moderate efficacy and high rates of serious toxicities. Therefore, there is a need for alternative chemotherapeutic agents that are superior or have at least equivalent efficacy as lomustine but less toxicity.  In a retrospective review of our centre using tamoxifen in recurrent glioma, the use of tamoxifen as a single agent in 167 patients, typically as third line treatment or beyond, resulted in at least stable disease for approximately 20% of patients with a median survival of >20 months for recurrent non-GBM and >10 months for recurrent GBM. Tamoxifen was well tolerated with no toxicities reported. Tamoxifen may be a better alternative to lomustine where only 20% of patients treated are alive in six months, typically with high rates of toxicity.  Primary Objective  ¡Ü To compare one-year progression-free survival rate of lomustine and tamoxifen treatment in patients with first recurrence of GBM.  Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate the overall survival following treatment in both arms To evaluate adverse events reported following treatment in both arms To evaluate health-related quality-of-life as assessed EORTC QLQ-BN20 questionnaires in both arms  Treatment plan includes:  Arm 1: Lomustine 110 mg/m2 as a single dose at bedtime on day 1 only every 42 days cycle Arm 2: Tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 3 days then 20 mg BID for 3 days then increase by 20 mg daily every 3 days until 100 mg BID, continuously"
494,The Safety and Efficacy of DCA for the Treatment of Brain Cancer,NCT00540176,"Malignant gliomas, which include Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are the most common and most aggressive types of brain cancer, accounting for approximately 60% of primary brain tumors. These tumors are characterized by diverse molecular abnormalities (within the same tumor), which, along with the difficulties of many standard chemotherapies crossing the blood barrier, contribute to the very poor response to therapy and poor survival.  We recently showed that Dichloroacetate (DCA, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) was able to depolarize cancer (but not normal) mitochondria and induce apoptosis in cancer but not normal tissues. We believe that altering the metabolism of cancers like glioblastoma (DCA switches metabolism from the cytoplasmic glycolysis to the mitochondrial glucose oxidation) we inhibit the resistance to apoptosis that characterizes cancer. Because metabolism (i.e. glycolysis) is the end result of many and diverse molecular pathways, the effects of DCA might be positive in cancers with diverse molecular backgrounds. DCA is also a very small molecule that readily crosses the blood brain barrier. Therefore we hypothesize that DCA will be an effective and relative non-toxic potential therapy for malignant gliomas.  We are conducting a phase II trial with 2 parallel arms: a) patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas and b) patients with recurrent gliomas or gliomas that have failed standard therapy (which includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy). All patients need to have a histological diagnosis. DCA will be given orally and patients will be followed for a minimum of 6 months. The tumor size will be followed by standard MRI or CT criteria and glucose uptake (a direct effect of DCA on the tumor) will be measured by FDG-PET imaging. Several clinical parameters and quality of life will be followed. Potential toxicity (particularly peripheral neuropathy) will be closely followed and dose-de-escalation protocols are in place in case of toxicity. In addition, escape protocols for the application of standard therapy (when appropriate) are in place in patients with no evidence of response to DCA. In vitro studies will be performed in the tissues obtained at the time of surgery (where appropriate) and correlated prospectively with clinical data.  There is limited ability to accept patients outside of Alberta; this is in part because the visit and testing schedule is intense, requiring residence in Edmonton for at least 6 months."
495,Phase 1b Study PVSRIPO for Recurrent Malignant Glioma in Children,NCT03043391,"PVSRIPO will be delivered intratumorally by CED using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor. The population group are patients with recurrent WHO grade III or IV malignant glioma who are aged 12 through 21 years old. After a single dose of PVSRIPO, subjects will return for periodic visits to monitor tumor status, adverse events, and changes in blood immune profiles. A maximum of 12 pediatric patients will be treated with PVSRIPO, and then carefully monitored for safety for at least a year after treatment."
496,"Safety and Effectiveness Study of G207, a Tumor-Killing Virus, in Patients With Recurrent Brain Cancer",NCT00028158,"Protocol NG1-003 is an open-label, phase Ib/II study of the safety and efficacy of G207, a genetically engineered herpes simplex type-1 virus. Up to 21 patients will be enrolled in the phase Ib portion and will receive doses of G207 that are higher than tested in the previous trials. The highest G207 dose tested in a previous phase I trial (NG1-001) was 3E9 plaque forming units (pfu). G207 was generally well tolerated and safe in NG1-001, and there was no dose-limiting toxicity. Patients' deaths were due to progressive cancer disease except for one (due to radiation necrosis), and two patients remain alive today.  Patients in the phase Ib portion of NG1-003 will receive G207 in divided doses. Initially, 15% of the assigned dose will be injected into the tumor. Two days later, the tumor will be removed, and the assigned dose of G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of resection. The assigned doses are as follows: 1E9, 3E9, and 1E10 pfu. Patient status will be followed by MRI, Karnofsky performance, neurologic examination and the presence of G207 virus in the body, in addition to other medical tests done at specific study visits.  The phase II portion of protocol NG1-003 is a two-stage study. The phase II portion will begin only if there are no safety concerns in the phase Ib portion. The goals are to determine the safety of G207 and survival at six months. Enrollment of up to 14 patients is planned for stage one. Additional patients will be enrolled (up to 30 additional patients and 44 overall) in stage II if at least 6 of the 14 patients in stage 1 survive 6 months or longer. Participants in phase II will receive a single dose of G207 at the highest dose determined to be safe from phase Ib. G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of resection. Again, patient status will be followed as previously described and survival will be evaluated."
497,Trial of C134 in Patients With Recurrent GBM,NCT03657576,"The efficacy of herpes simplex virus (HSV) as a treatment for brain tumors has been demonstrated experimentally. The earliest studies used an HSV that was genetically engineered so that the gene for an important enzyme, thymidine kinase (tk) was deleted. This engineered virus still killed tumor cells but was not toxic. Martuza and colleagues demonstrated that tumors implanted in mice shrank following treatment with varying doses of this virus.  Additional modified viruses based on the HSV backbone have been developed and tested with encouraging results.Viruses containing deletions in other important viral genes (e.g., DNA polymerase and the gene which can make the virus neurotoxic, ¥ã134.5), also retained the capability of killing cultured human tumors but did not injure mice; in particular, they were safe for use in the brain. These viruses retained the viral tk gene, and so are susceptible to the antiviral drug acyclovir which is routinely used to treat HSV Infection, making them even more safe .  Martuza and colleagues generated G207, a modified HSV that contains (1) deletions of both copies of ¥ã134.5 and (2) another gene called ribonucleotide reductase, was disabled secondary to disruption of the U139 gene by insertion of the E. coli LacZ coding region . G207 significantly prolonged survival of nude mice bearing human tumors. In addition, virus injected into the brains of the HSV sensitive primates (Aotus) did not produce any deleterious side effects.  G207 and 1716 have both been used in human trials. A dose-escalating phase 1 study of G207 was completed in patients with recurrent, progressive malignant glioma . The trial was conducted at University of Alabama at Birmingham and Georgetown University Medical Center. Twenty-one patients were enrolled in a total of seven dose-escalating cohorts, with three patients per cohort. Patients were stereotactically inoculated with G207 in the enhancing portions of their tumors. Five separate loci were inoculated in the final cohort; all previous cohorts were inoculated in a single locus within the enhancing tissue only. No toxicity definitively related to G207 was observed at doses up to 3 x 109 plaque forming units (pfu-these are active viral particles). In fact, a toxic dose level was not attained during this trial. This was due to viral processing techniques, limiting the total dose that could be administered.  In a Phase IB study, six patients with recurrent, resectable malignant glioma were enrolled at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in a trial examining a split dose administration strategy of G207. Patients underwent inoculation of G207 into their tumors, followed two to five days later by resection of the tumor and reinoculation of G207 into the tumor cavity. No dose limiting toxicities were seen in the trial, although one patient suffered a twelve hour period of mental status changes, weakness, and an elevated temperature when a protocol deviation resulted in an inadvertent partial dose of virus being administered intraventricularly, into the cerebrospinal fluid chamber of the brain. The patient fully recovered quickly and fully. One of the six patients went nearly two years before remote recurrence of her glioblastoma multiforme resulted in her death. A third study in 9 patients with recurrent malignant glioma was completed in which G207 was being administered followed by a single small dose of 5Gy of radiation. Nine patients were followed without any dose limiting toxicity, and some patients had remarkable responses to treatment. Currently, two clinical studies of oncolytic HSV are underway that examine G207 in pediatric patients as well as a novel oncolytic HSV expressing IL- 12, in adult patients. No findings of these two studies have yet been reported.  C134 was designed to replicate better than 1st gen HSVs. C134 is created by by inserting the PKR evasion gene, IRS1. from an evolutionary distant herpesvirus HCMV, which allows the virus to replicate much better but does not produce toxicity.  The described G207 trials clearly demonstrate that increased immune cell infiltrates within MG are associated with better outcomes. C134 elicits a robust immune response that contributes greatly to its antitumor effects.  C134 combines advantages of both wild-type and ¥Ä¥ã134.5 HSV and is an improvement over 1st generation viruses. C134 replicates and lyses tumor cells like a wild-type HSV in the IFN aberrant tumor environment, but is safe in normal cells. C134 induces immune responses which exceed those produced by 1st generation viruses. The study is designed to use all the information from any patients already treated to determine what the best dose for the next patient should be."

The MTD is defined as the dose immediately preceding that at which 3 of 3-6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at day 28, then every 2 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter, until another therapy is begun or disease progression is documented.  PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-42 patients will be accrued for this study over 14-27 months."
501,Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for Recurrent Pediatric Brain Tumors,NCT01682746,"The goal of this proposal is to evaluate a new Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) modification which could revolutionize the treatment of brain tumors in children and adults. There are currently few cases published involving the use of PDT in infratentorial (in the posterior fossa) brain tumors in general and specifically those occurring in children. The investigators propose to test a technique, for the first time in the U.S., that demonstrated in Australian adult glioblastoma patients dramatic long-term, survival rates of 57% (anaplastic astrocytoma) and 37% (glioblastoma multiforme). These results are unprecedented in any other treatment protocol.  Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a paradigm shift in the treatment of tumors from the traditional resection and systemic chemotherapy methods. The principle behind photodynamic therapy is light-mediated activation of a photosensitizer that is selectively accumulated in the target tissue, causing tumor cell destruction through singlet oxygen production. Therefore, the photosensitizer is considered to be the first critical element in PDT procedures, and the activation procedure is the second step. The methodology used in this proposal utilizes more intensive laser light and larger Photofrin photosensitizer doses than prior PDT protocols in the U.S. for brain tumor patients. The PDT will consist of photoillumination at 630 nm beginning at the center of the tumor resection cavity, and delivering a total energy of 240 J cm-2. The investigators feel that the light should penetrate far enough into the tissue to reach migrating tumor cells, and destroy these cells without harming the healthy cells in which they are dispersed.  The investigators will be testing the hypothesis that pediatric subjects with progressive/recurrent malignant brain tumors undergoing PDT with increased doses of Photofrin? and light energy than were used in our previous clinical study will show better progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes. PDT will also be effective against infratentorial tumors. The specific aims include determining the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of Photofrin in children and looking for preliminary effectiveness trends."

504,"Sorafenib Tosylate, Valproic Acid, and Sildenafil Citrate in Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma",NCT01817751,"The combination of sorafenib, valproic acid, and sildenafil may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma in the clinic. The combination of sorafenib and valproic acid is predicated on the basis that sorafenib activity is enhanced by HDAC inhibition. The addition of sildenafil is based on its ability to block ABCB1 and ABCG2 drug efflux pumps. As the ABCG2 transporter is the primary transporter involved in the efflux of sorafenib at the BBB, blocking its action is predicted to increase the concentration of sorafenib in the brain."
505,Study of Binimetinib With Encorafenib in Adults With Recurrent BRAF V600-Mutated HGG,NCT03973918,"Primary Objective Estimate the efficacy of combination treatment with encorafenib and binimetinib, as measured by response rate (RANO criteria), in patients with recurrent BRAF V600E/K-mutated malignant glioma (MG) and anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXAs).  Secondary Objectives  Estimate efficacy as measured by progression-free survival in subjects with recurrent malignant glioma or anaplastic PXA containing a BRAF-V600E/K mutation who receive drug. Evaluate duration of response in subjects who have a partial or complete response. Quantify the time-to-response among subjects who have a radiologic response. Estimate efficacy as measured by overall survival in subjects with recurrent malignant glioma or anaplastic PXA containing a BRAF-V600E/K mutation who receive drug. Characterize the toxicity profile of the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib in this patient population.  There are two arms: medical and surgical. Subjects on the surgical arm must have a high-grade glioma or a known BRAF-mutated low-grade glioma with high clinical suspicion for progression to high-grade.  Medical: Following enrollment, patients will receive encorafenib and binimetinib at the FDA-approved dose of 450 mg of encorafenib once daily and the FDA-approved dose of 45 mg of binimetinib twice daily separated by 12 hours, continuously in 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be followed by routine blood work, and general and neurological examination. A brain MRI will be performed prior to every odd-numbered cycle (every 8 weeks). Response will be assessed by RANO criteria. Patients may remain on study and receive treatment until progression or other reason.  Surgical: These subjects will take encorafenib and binimetinib in combination at their FDA-approved doses for 10-14 days prior to surgery. The last dose of both drugs will be administered two hours prior to surgery. Specimens will be collected during surgery. After surgery, the subjects will not take further encorafenib or binimetinib until a study visit to assess their neurological exam, physical exam, and performance status, at 2-6 weeks post-operatively. At time of restarting combination treatment, subjects will follow the schedule for the medical cohort, and will continue treatment until progression."

The patient will remain in the hospital during the entire infusion. At the completion of the infusion, the catheters will be removed within 6 hours and a CT scan will be obtained after the catheters are pulled. The patient will be observed in hospital for a minimum of another 6 hours.  A two-stage continual reassessment method (CRM) design will be used to determine the MTD of D2C7-IT where the first stage involves dose escalation in successive patients until an initial dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. Cohorts of 2 patients will be accrued to this study within both stages of the trial. The first patient of each cohort will be observed through the completion of the D2C7-IT infusion, before additional patients in that cohort are treated. Once the optimal dose level of D2C7-IT is determined (dose escalation completed), a total of 27 recurrent patients with WHO grade IV malignant glioma patients will be treated at that dose level as a dose expansion cohort.  Following D2C7-IT infusion, subjects will be evaluated in clinic at 2 weeks for adverse events and followed at 4 and 8 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter until 48 weeks."
508,Nivolumab With DC Vaccines for Recurrent Brain Tumors,NCT02529072,"This two-arm randomized trial will evaluate the safety of nivolumab in combination with DC vaccinations for the treatment of bevacizumab-na?ve subjects with first or second recurrent, resectable World Health Organization (WHO) Grade III and IV malignant gliomas (MGs). Up to 66 patients will be enrolled and treated with the goal of accruing 30 patients (15 per arm) that will receive nivolumab and at least 3 vaccines. After enrollment, leukapheresis will be done for generation of DC vaccines and immunologic monitoring. All subjects will undergo standard of care tetanus booster vaccination with 0.5 mL of Td (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed) intramuscularly (I.M.) into the deltoid muscle to ensure adequate immunity to the tetanus antigen. Subjects will initially return every 2 weeks and receive approximately 3 infusions of nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV while the DC vaccines are being prepared from the initial leukapheresis and will then be randomized 1:1 to one of 2 arms (Group I: nivolumab only pre-surgery; Group II: nivolumab with DC vaccines pre-surgery). Patients who are unable to tolerate nivolumab will be withdrawn from the study and replaced. Patients whose DCs or Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBLs) fail to meet release criteria will continue to receive nivolumab only and will not undergo repeat leukapheresis. For patients whose leukapheresis yields less than 4 vaccines, a repeat leukapheresis may be obtained a minimum of 2 weeks from the previous leukapheresis (and may be repeated as needed) if stable. Peripheral blood will be drawn for immune monitoring prior to treatment with the 4th cycle of nivolumab (first post-randomization infusion of nivolumab).  Group I Treatment Plan (Nivolumab Only Pre-Surgery) After randomization, patients in Group I will receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks x approximately 8 weeks.

522,AZD8055 for Adults With Recurrent Gliomas,NCT01316809,"Background:  Recurrent glioma patients have very limited treatment options. A significant percentage of gliomas have increased activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, mostly due to loss of PTEN. AZD8055 is a first in-class inhibitor of the kinase activity of mTOR, specifically inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Preclinical data generated in the Neuro-Oncology Branch Laboratory of Dr. Howard Fine demonstrated that AZD8055 has significant anti-glioma activity in vivo and in vitro.  Objectives:  To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous once daily AZD8055 in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED). To generate pharmacokinetic data on continuous once daily AZD8055 dosing.  Eligibility:  -Patients with histologically proven glioma are eligible for this study. Patients should have failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy.  Design:  This study will accrue up to 24 evaluable patients (non-surgical arm). Cohorts of 3 or 6 patients will receive continuous AZD8055 once daily orally for 42 days. The MTD will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 6 weeks of treatment only. Up to three patients may be enrolled simultaneously at each dose level. The dose of AZD8055 can be progressively escalated if only 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity at the prior dose level. A subset of patients in whom tumor re-resection is considered standard of care will receive 1-week treatment with AZD8055 and then undergo resection. Patients will be treated at the highest dose level shown to be safe at the time of enrollment. Once patients recover from surgery, they will restart treatment with AZD8055 and stay on treatment as long as there is no tumor progression or protocol-mandated removal criteria. Management of toxicity will be the same as non-surgical patients receiving their second and subsequent cycles of therapy as delineated in the protocol. Up to 12 patients will enter the surgical arm of this trial. The accrual ceiling will be open to 42 patients to factor in replacing those who come off  treatment prior to cycle 1.  -At the end of Cycle 1, patients in both treatment arms (surgical and non-surgical) may choose to continue to receive AZD8055 until disease progression or until they experience unmanageable drug related toxicity, as long as they are continuing to derive clinical benefit and do not fulfill any of the criteria for removal from protocol therapy."
523,Trial of Heat Shock Protein Peptide Complex-96 (HSPPC-96) Vaccine,NCT02722512,"Immunotherapy for Brain Tumors:  Although it is usually ineffective alone, it has long been recognized that the immune system of tumor bearing hosts (human and animal models) does, indeed, mount an endogenous immune-mediated response to tumor. Unfortunately, this immune response alone is not sufficient in combating tumor. The balance of immune response and immune regulation often mitigates this anti-tumor response. Several mechanisms within tumor-bearing hosts compromise the efficacy of this anti-tumor immune response, including low levels of expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as the B7 family of immune-regulatory ligands, the tumor's local production of immunosuppressive factors and the tumor's ability to over-express pro-survival factors thus escaping destruction by the host immune system. However, many have hypothesized that if this immune response can be better harnessed and/or magnified, there is potential for heightened tumor responses.  A number of specific observations support the use of immunotherapy to treat brain tumors. Data published supports a possible correlation between HIV mediated immunosuppression and the development of intracranial glial tumors. Immunosuppression in transplant recipients has also been implicated in the development of intracranial glioma. Further supporting this hypothesis are documented rare cases of long-term remission of malignant brain tumors following significant post-operative infection. These observations have fueled the idea that a heightened immune system may confer some protection against intracranial tumors. With this in mind, one hypothesis is that successful active immunotherapy for patients with brain tumors will require development of a specific peptide or polyvalent vaccines in an effort to further stimulate the host's immune system against specific tumor-associated antigens.  It has been well established that mice can be immunized against syngeneic tumors. Heat shock protein-peptide complexes isolated from a specific tumor can been utilized to elicit both prophylactic and therapeutic immunity against the specific cancer from which the preparations have been isolated. Overexpression of heat shock protein-chaperone complexes (HSPPC) in brain tumor cells suggests that HSPPC are a meaningful target antigen for a brain tumor vaccine. Moreover, in addition to generating tumor-specific immunity, vaccination with heat shock protein peptide complexes in animal models generates therapeutic responses. Since an immune response has not been widely evaluated for pediatric brain tumors, this study will test the safety and feasibility of producing and administering a vaccine capable of generating an autologous, anti-tumor immune response.  HSPPC-96:  Heat shock proteins are up-regulated along with tissue-specific chaperone peptides in the setting of cellular stress to prevent damage and aggregation of the proteome. Therefore, heat shock protein peptide complexes (HSPPC) provide a cytoprotective effect. Overexpression of heat shock proteins has been described in malignant glioma and medulloblastoma cells. HSPPC-96 is an autologous tumor-derived vaccine that has been under clinical investigation for the treatment of a variety of cancer types, including adult high-grade glioma (HGG). It is composed of the 96-kilodalton (KDa) heat shock protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), attached to autologous tumor-derived peptides. The gp96 glycoprotein in HSPPC-96 is a highly conserved, abundant, non-polymorphic stress protein found in every cell type of the body. Gp96 isolated from normal or tumor tissues is found in complex with peptides that are specific to the original tissue. Mouse models have shown that HSPPC-96 confers protective immunity only to the tumor from which it is derived and not to genetically distinct tumors or normal tissue.  When injected into the host, HSPPC-96 interacts with antigen presenting cells (APCs) via specific receptors. Once internalized by the APCs, the peptides chaperoned by the HSP are transferred to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules in intracellular compartments and eventually expressed at the cell surface. T-cells then recognize the MHC-peptide complexes and are stimulated. HSP-peptide complexes are unique in their ability to elicit an antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell response. Additionally, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are also recruited adding to the tumor-associated immunity.  Some advantages of heat shock protein-peptide vaccines for immunotherapy are that it elicits a cluster of differentiation (CD8+) T cell response in spite of exogenous administration, it circumvents the need for identification of T-cell epitopes of individual cancers, and it minimizes the possibility of generating epitope variants. Furthermore, heat shock protein-peptide complexes have elicited tumor rejection and CD8+ T cell response without adjuvant therapies. Heat shock protein-peptide complexes, such as HSPPC-96, can be isolated from human tumors, and when injected back into the patient from whom they were isolated, may present a unique opportunity to deliver a vaccine specific to that patient."
524,Safety and Dose-Finding Study of TM-601 in Adults With Recurrent Malignant Glioma,NCT00591058,"This Phase I study will evaluate the safety of TM-601 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma who have failed first-line, standard therapy.  Study patients will be assigned to receive treatment in 1 of 6 treatment cohorts. Patients will be assigned to each dose level in groups of 3-6 (depending upon treatment response seen within each cohort), with escalation to the next highest dose dependent upon demonstrated tolerance in the previous dosing group.  Patients will be administered an imaging dose of 131I-TM-601, intravenously, to demonstrate tumor-specific localization prior to study treatment with non-labeled TM-601. Eligible patients demonstrating tumor-specific imaging will be assigned to a treatment cohort and will received non-labeled TM-601 once a week for 3 weeks, followed by clinical follow-up visits and MR imaging.  Data from this study will help determine the IV dose of TM-601 required to produce MR perfusion changes (as well as other biomarker changes) in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. It is not known whether participation in this trial will provide patients with benefit in terms of improved tumor control, although pre-clinical evidence and evidence from other clinical trials with 131I TM-601 suggest that TM-601 is an active agent in malignant glioma."
525,Neo-adjuvant Treatment With Temozolomide and Bevacizumab Previous to Temozolomide Plus Radiation Plus Bevacizumab Therapy in Unresectable Glioblastoma,NCT01102595,"In the last 20 years, only temozolomide has obtained indication for the treatment of High-grade glioma (HGG). Temozolomide during and later radiation therapy has doubled one year survival and is the standard treatment for glioblastoma. But 30% of glioblastomas receive only a biopsy as they can't be resected and don't get benefit from this treatment. They and should be treated immediately after the biopsy to prevent neurological deterioration but in spite of this approach they often deteriorate neurologically during radiotherapy. . An effective pre-radiation treatment should improve their prognosis and allow them to complete concomitant radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment. Bevacizumab in recurrent HGG displays 63% of objective responses when combined with irinotecan. But irinotecan is not the most active treatment in this disease.  We propose a phase II, two arms, open label, randomized, multicentric study with 2 cycles of temozolomide before radiation therapy and concomitant temozolomide, in patients with glioblastoma and 'biopsy-only'. Bevacizumab will be added to one arm."

This is a first in human (FIH), open-label, sequential-dose-escalation study in subjects with EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma or malignant glioma. This study will enroll 2 groups of subjects according to disease stage, recurrent disease (Group 1) and maintenance treatment after SoC in newly diagnosed disease (Group 2)."
527,Safety and Efficacy Study of Intracranially Implanted Carmustine to Treat Recurrent Malignant Glioma,NCT01637753,"Malignant gliomas recur mostly 2 cm within originated area. Local therapies therefore become particular important. Gliadel wafer developed in the States and marketed in the developed countries is an example of such treatments. The product in this study, Carmustine Sustained Release Implant (CASANT), is similar to that of Gliadel wafer as for the API(Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient), but different as for drug delivering system. As required, the preliminary clinical studies were conducted in China. Based on the results of phase I/II , 8-10 wafers containing given dose of BCNU will be administered intracranially in this phase III to the tumor resected cavity to investigate the safety and efficacy in the treatment of recurrent malignant glioma in 212 patients."
528,Pilot Study of Cabozantinib for Recurrent or Progressive High-Grade Glioma in Children,NCT02885324,"This pilot will study the feasibility and exploratory efficacy of using Cabozantinib for recurrent or refractory high grade glioma for which there are no curative options. Patients will also be followed for safety, time to progression, event free survival and overall survival"
529,Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for Recurrent Gliomas,NCT01166308,"Treatment of patients with recurrent glioma includes neurosurgical resection, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. In most cases, a full course of radiotherapy has been applied after primary diagnosis, therefore application of re-irradiation has to be applied cautiously. With modern precision photon techniques such as fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT), a second course of radiotherapy is safe and effective and leads to survival times of 22, 16 and 8 months for recurrent WHO grade II, III and IV tumors.  Carbon ions offer physical and biological characteristics. Due to their inverted dose profile and the high local dose deposition within the Bragg peak precise dose application and sparing of normal tissue is possible. Moreover, in comparison to photons, carbon ions offer an increase relative biological effectiveness (RBE), which can be calculated between 2 and 5 depending on the Glioblastoma (GBM) cell line as well as the endpoint analyzed. Protons, however, offer an RBE which is comparable to photons.  First Japanese Data on the evaluation of carbon ion radiation therapy for the treatment of primary high-grade gliomas showed promising results in a small and heterogeneous patient collective.  In the current Phase I/II-CINDERELLA-trial re-irradiation using carbon ions will be compared to FSRT applied to the area of contrast enhancement representing high-grade tumor areas in patients with recurrent gliomas. Within the Phase I Part of the trial, the Recommended Dose (RD) of carbon ion radiotherapy will be determined in a dose escalation scheme. In the subsequent randomized Phase II part, the RD will be evaluated in the experimental arm, compared to the standard arm, FSRT with a total dose of 36 Gy in single doses of 2 Gy.  Primary endpoint of the Phase I part is toxicity. Primary endpoint of the randomized part II is survival after re-irradiation at 12 months, secondary endpoint is progression-free survival."
530,Predicting Sites of Tumour Progression in the Invasive Margin of Glioblastomas (PRaM-GBM Study),NCT03294434,"This is a multicentre, prospective longitudinal observational cohort study in patients with high grade glioma, who have surgery planned to remove >90% of the tumour, and subsequent radical radiotherapy with concomitant tomozolomide. The purpose of this study is to establish a model using DTI that can accurately predict the site of where glioblastomas will progress after treatment. This study aims to validate the use of DTI as a biomarker across multiple centres to develop analysis methods that could be used in the future to personalise radiotherapy treatment volumes, and potentially surgical targets.  Patients will be given a DTI-MRI both prior to the operation and prior to radiotherapy. Clinical MRIs will take place according to standard guidelines. Whilst the study is open patients will participate in the study until death. Once a total of 70 patients from the first 90 have shown true progression patients will participate in the study for a minimum of 6 months from the beginning of radiotherapy.  This study will be conducted in 6-10 NHS centres, where 120 patients will be recruited, patients who are withdrawn will be replaced."
531,Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) for Locally Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer,NCT01173172,"This is a prospective, single arm, open label phase I/II trial with boron neutron capture (BNCT) therapy for patients with previously irradiated and locally recurrent head and neck cancer.  The eligibility criteria are patients with locoregionally recurrent head and neck cancer; good performance status; inoperable, clinical measurable tumor size; good organ function and good compliance. No systemic treatment is in use. Once entering this study, patients will receive angiographies to evaluate bloody supply of the tumor and PET scan with 18F-fluoro-L-BPA as the tracer. Tumor-to- normal tissue ratios were evaluated from static emission scans. Boron concentration of normal tissues is derived from measurement of BPA concentration in the blood. Treatment planning with THORplan will be done after Computerized Tomography (CT) simulation. After treatment plan approved and on the day of treatment, intravenous or intra-arterial L-BPA- Fructose complex 500 mg/kg was administered at a constant rate over about 3 hours before and during neutron irradiation. Neutron beam irradiations were given at the THOR with prescription dose of 20 to 25 Gy (Eq) for the tumor in one fraction on day 1 and repeated on day 30. Patients will be regularly followed up at OPD for toxicities (NCI Common Terminology Criteria) and response evaluation (RECIST criteria)by MRI and PET, time to progression measurement, survival status and change of quality of life. Maximally 27 patients will be enrolled. After first 10 patients, the preliminary results will be reviewed before further patients' enrollment."
532,Study Testing The Safety and Efficacy of Adjuvant Temozolomide Plus TTFields (Optune?) Plus Pembrolizumab in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma (2-THE-TOP),NCT03405792,"Patients with newly-diagnosed GBM who undergo maximal safe resection (biopsy alone is eligible) followed by standard chemoradiation will be eligible for this trial.  Four weeks after completing chemoradiation, patients will undergo baseline standard of care MRI. Four to six weeks after finishing chemoradiation, patients will start monthly cycles of adjuvant TMZ. A minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ will be given. Treatment with Optune will start at approximately the same time as the first cycle of adjuvant TMZ and continue until second disease progression or a maximum of 2 years. Within one week after starting Cycle 2 of adjuvant TMZ and Optune therapy, patients will begin open-label treatment with pembrolizumab every 3 weeks until first disease progression or unacceptable toxicities or 2 years, whichever comes first.  At first progression, patients will be allowed to continue with Optune therapy combined with any other therapy, which may include pembrolizumab, per standard of care at the discretion of the treating physician. Surgical resection or biopsy of first recurrent tumor for confirmation of recurrence is allowed within the protocol.  All patients will be seen before Cycle 1 of TMZ, before cycle 2 of TMZ, before starting the second dose of pembrolizumab, and every 3 weeks before each subsequent pembrolizumab dose at an outpatient clinic until they complete all 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ or discontinue TMZ due to toxicity or first progression.  Medical follow-up will continue for 30 days after treatment termination. After this visit, mortality will be assessed based on telephone interviews with the patients or the patients' caregivers every 3 months."
533,Ph. I Dasatinib/Protracted Temozolomide in Recurrent Malignant Glioma,NCT00734864,"This is an open-label, single center, one-arm phase I dose-escalation study of dasatinib plus protracted , daily TMZ administered orally on a continuous daily dosing schedule among adult patients with recurrent or relapsing malignant glioma. The study format includes a classical ""3+3"" dose escalation design to determine the MTD and DLT of dasatinib plus protracted, daily TMZ among recurrent malignant glioma patients. Patients will be stratified based on whether they are receiving EIAED and each stratum will independently dose escalate. Additionally, the study will characterize the safety, tolerability, biologic activity, and pharmacokinetic profile of dasatinib when used in combination with protracted, daily TMZ.  Patients will start treatment on day 1 of cycle 1 with dasatinib. For patients undergoing dasatinib pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, dasatinib will be administered alone until initial PK assessments are collected. Protracted TMZ will be initiated after initial dasatinib PK assessments are collected and will continue to be administered with dasatinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule. The initial dasatinib PK assessments will be collected over 24 hours between days 3-7 of cycle 1. Patients not undergoing dasatinib PK collections will begin both dasatinib and protracted, daily TMZ together on day 1, cycle 1.  The protracted, daily TMZ dose will be 50 mg/m©÷ daily for all patients. The dose level of dasatinib will be increased in successive cohorts. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will accrue at each dose level until MTD is defined. Each cohort will consist of a minimum of 3 newly enrolled patients. Intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted. It is estimated that this study will enroll a minimum of 30 patients (up to 4 dose levels/stratum; 3 patients/dose level for levels 1-3 and 6 patients at level 4) and a maximum of 48 patients (6 patients/dose level; 4 dose levels/stratum). Cohorts may be expanded at any dose level for further elaboration of safety and pharmacokinetic parameters as required.  The primary safety and efficacy analysis will be conducted on all patient data at the time all patients who are still receiving study drug will have completed at least 4 cycles of treatment. The additional data for any patients continuing to receive study drug past this time, as allowed by the protocol, will be further summarized in a report once these patients either completed or discontinued the study. Prior to the primary analysis, an additional safety report may be prepared.  The most common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia (loss of appetite), fluid retention, fatigue, headache, rash, hypocalcemia (low calcium level), and decreases in blood counts. Other possible side effects may include nausea, joint pain, muscle aches, generalized pain, abdominal pain, and fever. Rare side effects may include QTc prolongation (heart beat changes), pulmonary edema (fluid around the lungs), difficulty breathing, cough, hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, cardiac effusion (fluid in the sac surrounding the heart), and cardiac failure. Temodar has been well tolerated by both adults and children with the most common toxicity being mild myelosuppression. Other, less likely, potential toxicities include nausea and vomiting, constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning sensation of skin, esophagitis, pain, diarrhea, lethargy, hepatotoxicity, anorexia, fatigue and hyperglycemia. As in the case with many anti-cancer drugs, Temodar may be carcinogenic. Rats given Temodar have developed breast cancer."
534,"Stress, Exercise Behavior and Survival in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma and in a Close Partner",NCT02129335,"General Aim The aim of this prospective, multicenter observational cohort study is to determine the impact of baseline bio-behavioral stress (Aim I) on cancer progression and survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) undergoing standard radiochemotherapy. The role of baseline physical activity (PA) and baseline partner's distress as stress-modulating factors will be assessed in an exploratory analysis.  Secondary aims include a longitudinal assessment of self-reported psychological distress in this homogenous patient cohort and their partners (Aim II) and -in a translational subproject - to determine the role of serum copeptin as a biomarker for distress (Aim III).  Specific Aims Specific Aim I: Prognostic role of stress at the time of diagnosis in GBM patients In this analysis, baseline neuroendocrine stress will be correlated to progression-free survival (PFS).  More specifically we aim at assessing  IA) Whether stress-induced disruption of diurnal cortisol rhythmicity as measured by the salivary cortisol slope is an independent prognostic factor for (progression-free) survival in patients with newly diagnosed GBM undergoing standard multimodal treatment.  IB) Whether increased baseline self-reported physical activity is correlated with lower levels of stress (i.e. acts as a stress-modulating factor) and prolonged (progression-free) survival  IC) Whether high levels of stress in the patients' partner (baseline diurnal cortisol slope) are correlated with high levels of stress in the patient (i.e. stress-modulating factor) and shorter (progression-free) survival  Specific Aim II: Longitudinal cohort of patient-partner dyads In the same cohort of patients (Aim I above) we aim at describing distress over time (three-monthly) from start of combined radiochemotherapy to disease progression in patients and - as a paired dyad - in one close partner.  Specific Aim III: Copeptin biomarker subproject In a translational subproject we aim at assessing the prognostic role of baseline serum copeptin- an easy to test serum biomarker of stress in many clinical situations, which has never been assessed in cancer patients.  Methods Study design Since the prognostic role of stress in GBM has not been studied before, we propose in a first step an observational, prospective multicenter cohort study in a well-defined group of patients, all at the same stage of disease (initial diagnosis) and all undergoing the same standard multimodal treatment (surgery followed by radiochemotherapy according to R.Stupp et al.).  Patients All patients in good performance status (Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ¡Ã 50%), aged 18 years and older, with histologically confirmed, previously untreated GBM are eligible prior to starting initial treatment with radio-chemotherapy. In order to participate, patients will need to have given their informed consent on the ethics-approved consent form and will need to be willing and able (as judged by the investigator) to comply with the protocol. Cardiovascular contraindications to the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) and/or a history of instable angina pectoris or New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater congestive heart failure (according to the Thoracic Society recommendations) preclude trial inclusion. Equally, patients who have signs or symptoms (including laboratory findings) of conditions, either metabolic or psychological, that interfere with adequate assessment of the stress axis (e.g. chronic use of a corticosteroid, psychiatric disorder and medication) are excluded. Perioperative dexamethasone treatment is not an exclusion criterion as short time treatment does not clearly affect the HPA axis and synthetic corticosteroids can be discriminated in salivary cortisol measurements. Inability to follow study procedures, e.g. due to language problems, psychological disorders, dementia or confusion, is another reason for study exclusion.  Patients' partners Each patient designates his or her closest partner, (not necessarily intimate partners), either a person living in the same household or with daily contact (husband/wife, not married partner, other family members). In order to participate, the patient's partner must be older than 18 years, in a good performance status (KPS¡Ã50%), willing and able (as judged by the investigator) to comply with the protocol and must give informed consent.  If the patient has no partner or the partner is not willing to be part of the trial, participation in the cohort is still possible (the group of patients without partners will be analyzed separately).  Primary Endpoint for Aim I The primary endpoint is PFS, i.e. the time between diagnosis and disease progression (according to RANO criteria) or death of any cause.  Response evaluation in MRI will be done using the criteria by MacDonald et al. , which are specified in the RANO criteria. In brief, the definitions for ""progression"" is the following: At least 25% increase in the size of a solid mass or contrast-enhancing lesions on MRI (or CT) or the appearance of a new lesion or clinical deterioration.  Secondary Endpoints for Aim I  Secondary endpoints include overall survival and measures of treatment tolerance:  Number of patients, who stopped treatment for reasons other than progressive disease Percentage of planned temozolomide doses received  Study Flow and Assessments  Assessments Baseline (T1): predictor variables Baseline Assessment will occur at a strictly defined time point (T1) in order to minimize time-dependent confounders on predictor variables (particularly stress lab): Physical functioning tests and questionnaires will be performed on days -3 before start of radiochemotherapy. Salivary cortisol samples will be performed at days -2 and -1 before start of radiochemotherapy.  Baseline Consolidation (T2) The visit will take place 28d after T1 when patients have started their treatment (""steady-state""), for all non-progressing patients (which will be the vast majority at this early time-point) and includes the same assessments as T1. The purpose of T2 assessments is to validate T1 i.e. to confirm that T1 (baseline) has been representative for the condition patients and partners are in early during treatment and to exclude that T1 assessments have been unrepresentative due to the impending start of an unknown treatment. T2 assessments will be analyzed as confirmatory baseline prognostic factors in all non-progressing patients.  Follow up visits until progression (FU1) Follow-up visits will be done every 12 weeks. The purpose of the FU1 visits is i) to measure disease status in MRI for aim I (1¡Æ endpoint) and ii) to longitudinally describe distress, emotional functioning and quality of life (QoL) in patients and partners for aim II.  Follow up visits from progression to death (patients only) (FU2) After progression patients will be contacted every three months for survival status (dead or alive).  Study procedures Stress Aim I (predictor variables): Baseline Stress measurements in patients as well as partners at baseline (T1) and after 4 weeks (T2) i) Neuroendocrine stress evaluations using standard laboratory essays (salivary diurnal cortisol slope, cortisol awakening response (CAR), short adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-test as well as ii) Self-reported psychological distress evaluations by questionnaires (distress thermometer and perceived stress scale)  Aim II (descriptive variables): Distress in the longitudinal cohort will be evaluated every three months in patients-partners dyads with self-reported measures such as DT and PSS (ii above). Quality of life and emotional functioning will also be described as measured by the FACT-Br and HADS-D score  Ad i.)  Diurnal Cortisol Slope: Salivary cortisol levels peak 30-60 minutes after awakening and then drop to a nadir during sleep. This diurnal rhythm is disrupted in chronically stressed patients: leading to a flattening of the slope (beta) of the curve that connects salivary cortisol concentrations over time (from awakening to bedtime). Salivary cortisol will be measured on two consecutive days (patients will receive a kit with ""salivettes"" containers to use at home and store in the refrigerator until next day hospital visit). Salivary samples will be collected after waking up in the morning, 30 minutes later (for CAR below), at 4pm and at 9pm. Cortisol level analyses will be done by the immunoassay ECLIA (E170 Roche, Switzerland) at the reference hospital (University Hospital Basel). Sample storage and shipment can be performed at -20¡ÆC. The cortisol awakening response (CAR) describes the increase of about 50% in saliva cortisol levels, which occurs 20-30 minutes after waking up in the morning. It is thought to be linked to the hippocampus' preparation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) to face anticipated stress and it is independent from the circadian variation in the HPA axis. CAR provides an easy measure of the capacity of the HPA axis to react to stress. An increased CAR has been associated with burnout, worry and chronic stress at work. For CAR saliva samples will be collected on two consecutive days by passive drooling, immediately after awakening (0') and 30 min (30') later [45]. As perioperative dexamethasone is usually given in these patients, a short or ""low-dose"" ACTH test (Synacthen test) will be performed, to rule out relative adrenal insufficiency. The test reflects the adrenal function and is a validated and save tool routinely used in daily practice. A baseline sampling of Cortisol is performed before 1 ug Synacthen is applied by intravenous route. Stimulated Cortisol serum level is measured exactly 30min after Synacthen application. The test will be performed in the morning. Cortisol level analyses will be done by the immunoassay ECLIA (E170 Roche, Switzerland).  Ad ii) The distress-thermometer (DT) is a 10-point scale displayed in a thermometer format and was originally developed by Roth and colleagues (Appendix 1). Validity of DT has been examined for outpatient cancer patients as well as relatives.  The perceived stress scale (PSS) is a universally accepted, standardized unidimensional scale that assesses perceived stress by asking respondents to report whether their lives seem to be unpredictable or uncontrollable, or if they feel overburdened. It assesses the cognitively mediated emotional response to an objective event, rather than the objective event itself.  Quality of life (QOL) will be measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT). The FACT comprises a series of questionnaires to measure general QOL, as well as cancer- and condition-specific symptoms during and after cancer treatment. The questionnaires are broadly used and validated in several languages, including German. The following scales will be used: FACT-Br (brain), containing 37 items on physical wellbeing, family/social wellbeing, emotional wellbeing and functional wellbeing. For comparable evaluations in partners, an adapted version of the FACT-G (general) has been generated.  Emotional functioning: The German version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D) will be used to assess current levels of depression and anxiety. Each scale comprises 7 items, which are answered on a 4-point scale. The scale is widely used to evaluate emotional wellbeing in patients with chronic physical conditions and is validated for the German language.  Physical activity Exercise behavior will be evaluated in patients as well as in partners by self-reported physical activity in MET-hours per week, by Godin-Leisure-Time-Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ). In this questionnaire -validated in glioma patients- patients and partners are asked to complete a self-explanatory four-item query of usual leisure-time exercise habits.  -Physical condition (in patients only) will be tested using an internationally standardized test that does not need extensive equipment (which is important for practicability in the multicenter setting): A 6-Minute walking test (6MWT) is a simple method to evaluate functional capacity and has been tested in multiple settings. Patients will be instructed to walk at their fastest pace and to cover the longest possible distance over 6 minutes under the supervision of physical therapist. During exercise, oxyhemoglobin saturation and heart rate will be monitored by pulse oximetry.  Aim III: Copeptin Arginine Vasopressin (AVP) is a hypothalamic stress hormone, which is produced in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary. Together with corticotropin-releasing hormone, it leads to secretion of ACTH and cortisol. With the recent development of a novel sandwich immunoassay for copeptin (the C-terminal glycoprotein of the pre-provasopressin), a stable and easy to measure surrogate of AVP secretion has become available. (Direct AVP measurement is hampered by technical, pre-analytical difficulties). As a stress hormone copeptin mirrors individual stress levels even more subtly than cortisol."
535,Repeated Super-selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion of Bevacizumab (Avastin) for Treatment of Relapsed GBM and AA,NCT01269853,"The current standard of care for recurring GBM is for patients to receive Bevacizumab (Avastin) intravenously (IV) at 10mg/kg every two weeks until their tumor grows more than 25%. At that point, these patients are deemed treatment failures and are given another treatment. Because of the blood brain barrier (BBB) where IV drugs do not penetrate the blood vessel walls well to get into the brain, no one knows for sure if these IV drugs actually get into the brain after infusion. We have recently completed a Phase I clinical trial that has shown that SIACI of Bevacizumab is safe and effective up to a dose of 15mg/kg in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. This two arm open-label, non-randomized trial is a follow up study to that trial and will ask two simple questions: Is it safe to deliver repeated doses of Bevacizumab intraarterially using these super selective intraarterial delivery techniques? Is it necessary to combine this IA regimen of treatment with biweekly IV Bevacizumab in order to improve progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)? Information from this trial will yield important answers to the durability and efficacy of this delivery technique and may radically change the way chemotherapy is given to our patients with brain tumors.  Current Standard of Care:  Day 0: Intravenous Bevacizumab (10mg/kg) Day 14, 28 (and every two weeks thereafter): Intravenous Bevacizumab  Therefore the experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:  Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol 20%; 12.5 mL/s over 2 minutes) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma. We have used this without complication in the 30 patients from our Phase I protocol as well. To treat patients with one of two arms with repeated intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of Bevacizumab for patients with recurring or relapsing high grade glioma. Each arm gets IA delivery with one arm getting IV Bevacizumab biweekly as well and the other arm not getting intervening IV therapy. In each arm, IA therapy is repeated when MRI shows progression. Persistent progression after three intraarterial chemotherapies would remove the patient from the trial."
536,V-Boost Immunotherapy in Glioblastoma Multiforme Brain Cancer,NCT03916757,"The proposed Phase II trial is an-open label study of the safety and efficacy of V-Boost in newly diagnosed or treatment-refractory patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) following unsuccesfull resection and/or chemoradiation. The Phase I clinical tria,l carried out in a small, open-label study, demonstrated safety and promising efficacy. The purpose of this study is to gain additional information from a larger clinical trial aimed to recruit at least 20 patients with GBM. Patients may be newly diagnosed with GBM or are those who have been subjected to resection and/or chemotherapy or radiation, but without success. Patients need to have imaging records and health assessment prior to study enrollment. Those on chemotherapy or radiation can be in washout period or may receive immunotherapy concurrently. Patients will be administered daily dose of V-Boost oral tablet for at least one month and additional dosing can be envisaged depending on outcome of first month. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect on tumor size and progression free survival (PFS) in comparison to patients on standard of care."
537,Repeated Super-selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion Of Bevacizumab Plus Carboplatin For Treatment Of Relapsed/Refractory GBM And Anaplastic Astrocytoma,NCT01386710,"The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA. Initial therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. All patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). The investigators have shown in a previous phase I trial that a single Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) of Bevacizumab (up to 15mg/kg) is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent GBM. Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an extension of that trial in that the investigators seek to test the hypothesis that repeated dosing of intra-arterial Bevacizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent malignant glioma. Additionally the investigators will analyze if a combination with IA Carboplatin will further improve the treatment response. By achieving the aims of this study the investigators will also determine if IV therapy with Bevacizumab with IV Carboplatin should be combined with repeated selected intra-arterial Bevacizumab plus Carboplatin to improve progression free and overall survival. The investigators expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of repeated SIACI Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to the investigators patients in the near future."
538,Perifosine and Torisel (Temsirolimus) for Recurrent/Progressive Malignant Gliomas,NCT02238496,"Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common subtype in adults, representing more than 50% of gliomas. Standard initial treatment for newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy to the tumor bed and chemotherapy with an oral DNA alkylator, temozolomide. However, recurrence is nearly universal despite standard therapy. There is no standard treatment at recurrence. Median survival is about 15 months from diagnosis and 6 months from recurrence. Once patients develop tumor progression, conventional chemotherapy is generally ineffective."
539,Bevacizumab and Irinotecan or Bevacizumab and Temozolomide With Concomitant Radiotherapy for Primary Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM),NCT00817284,"Significant activity (radiographic response rates of approximately 60%) has recently been demonstrated in phase II studies in patients with relapsed GBM from the combined use of Irinotecan (CPT-11) and bevacizumab. The 6-month progression-free survival rate is 30% and median survival duration is 9 months. The current first line therapy of GBM patients following initial surgical resection/debulking is the concomitant use of cerebral radiotherapy and the orally available alkylating agent temozolomide, followed by temozolomide for 6 months post-radiotherapy.  Considering the significant activity of the combination of Bevacizumab + irinotecan in patients with recurrent GBM, and considering the activity of temozolomide in GBM, it is proposed that the combination of Bevacizumab + Temozolomide may also be an active regimen. Bevacizumab + Temozolomide display non-overlapping toxicity clinically and thus their combined use without significant dose-reductions seems rational.  The toxicity from the combined use of the two drugs prior to radiotherapy, as well as the toxicity when administered together with radiotherapy, is evaluated.  This study will try to identity whether Bevacizumab and Irinitecan or Bevacizumab and Temozolomide should be the experimental arm in future phase III comparison with standard care with concomitant Temozolomide and radiotherapy."

The exploratory goals are to measure the amount of ERK signaling pathway activity, to identify mechanisms of resistance to these drugs, and evaluate feasibility of measuring tumor DNA in cerebrospinal fluid.  People (adults or children) with brain tumors who are already taking dabrafenib and / or trametinib and are in need of a surgical resection are potentially eligible. On the day of surgery, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tumor tissue will be collected for research purposes."

In the phase I part of the study the optimal dose of BKM120 when combined with bevacizumab was determined. In the Phase II part of this study, patients with relapsed/refractory GBM following first line therapy are being treated with the BKM120/bevacizumab combination. Limited BKM120 pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed on all patients treated during this part of the study. Patients will be reevaluated for response to treatment after 2 cycles (8 weeks). Patients with objective response or stable disease will continue treatment, with subsequent reevaluations every 8 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  Two populations of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM will be treated in the Phase II trial: 1) patients with no previous exposure to bevacizumab (N= 55) and 2) patients who received bevacizumab as part of first-line combined modality treatment (N= 20)."
542,HSV G207 in Children With Recurrent or Refractory Cerebellar Brain Tumors,NCT03911388,"Outcomes for children with recurrent or progressive cerebellar malignant brain tumors are very poor, and there are a lack of effective salvage therapies once a patient fails standard treatments. G207 is an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV) that has been successfully engineered to introduce mutations in the virus that enable it to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells, but not normal cells. Replication of G207 in the tumor not only kills the infected tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus engenders an anti-tumor immune response; the virus is immunogenic and produces a debris field which exposes cancer cell antigens to immune cells which can target other cancer cells. Thus, the oncolytic effect of the virus and the immune response that the virus stimulates provide a ""one-two punch"" at attacking cancer cells. In preclinical studies, a single 5 Gy dose of radiation within 24 hours of virus inoculation to the tumor increased virus replication and tumor cell killing.  The safety of G207 has been demonstrated in 3 phase I clinical trials involving adults with supratentorial high-grade gliomas adults at the University of Alabama (UAB) and in an ongoing phase I clinical trial involving children with recurrent supratentorial brain tumors at Children's of Alabama. In the adult trials, high doses (up to 3 x 10^9 plaque-forming units) of virus were safely injected directly into the tumor or surrounding brain tissue without serious toxicities. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence of anti-tumor responses have been seen. Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that a variety of aggressive pediatric brain tumor types are sensitive to G207.  This study is a phase I, open-label, single institution clinical trial of G207 alone or combined with a single low dose of radiation in children with recurrent or progressive cerebellar brain tumors.The primary goal is to determine safety. The secondary aims are to obtain preliminary information on the effectiveness of and immune response to G207. A traditional 3 + 3 design will be used with four patient cohorts. The first cohort will receive G207 alone, and the next cohorts will receive G207 at one of three doses followed by a 5 Gy dose of radiation to active areas of tumor."
543,A Randomized Phase II Trial of Vandetanib (ZD6474) in Combination With Carboplatin Versus Carboplatin Alone Followed by Vandetanib Alone in Adults With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas,NCT00995007,"Background:  In vivo experiments have documented the ability of vandetanib (ZD6474) to inhibit tumor growth in various preclinical tumor models. Given the pronounced neovasculature associated with malignant gliomas, and abundant published data demonstrating the dependence of glioma growth on the maintenance and proliferation of this neovasculature, vandetanib represents a potentially promising new therapeutic approach to these otherwise refractory tumors. Phase II data of vandetanib for recurrent glioblastomas conducted at the National Institutes of Health showed promising activity but responses were usually short-lasting.  Carboplatin has shown activity as monotherapy in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas in adults and preclinical data generated at Dr. Fines' laboratory demonstrate additive anti-glioma activity with vandetanib. The safety profile of carboplatin and the preclinical and clinical data supports its use in combination with vandetanib in patients with malignant gliomas.  Vandetanib is also an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor and it has been demonstrated that the presence of the EGFRvIII mutant and/or the presence of an intact phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and non-phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT) predict for a higher likelihood of response to the EGFR inhibitors Tarceva and Iressa.  Objectives:  To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of vandetanib in combination with carboplatin and single agent carboplatin and to collect information regarding the spectrum of toxicities.  To determine if the presence of the EGFRvIII mutant and/or the presence of an intact PTEN and non-phosphorylated AKT predict for a higher likelihood of response to vandetanib.  Eligibility:  Patients with histologically proven malignant glioma are eligible for this study.  Design:  Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of two groups. Patients in group one will be treated with vandetanib (300 mg daily for patients not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and 400 mg daily for patients on EIAEDs) and with carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve at steady-state [area under curve (AUC)], 6mg/mL x min) once every 4-week cycle (combination group). Patients in group two will receive carboplatin alone (AUC 6mg/mL x min) once every 4-week cycle. Patients who develop tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity on carboplatin alone (group 2) can then receive single agent vandetanib (300 mg daily for patients not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and 400 mg daily for patients on EIAEDs) in 4-week cycles (sequential group). A total of 128 evaluable patients will be analyzed. The total accrual ceiling will allow for 74 patients to be enrolled in the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) stratum and 74 patients in the anaplastic gliomas (AG) stratum (total 148) to factor in replacing those patients who come off treatment prior to cycle 1."
544,"TIGER PRO-Active - Daily Activity, Sleep and Neurocognitive Functioning Study",NCT04717739,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary tumor of the brain with an annual incidence of approximately 3/100.000. Since 2005 the treatment for newly diagnosed GBM consisted of maximal surgical resection, approx. 60 Gy of radiotherapy together with chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ), followed by 6 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy. This treatment regimen demonstrated increased median overall survival (OS) from 12.1 to 14.6 months in comparison to surgery and radiotherapy alone in 2005.  Since 2005, despite plenty of clinical phase III trials conducted, Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy was the first treatment shown to significantly increase median progression-free survival (PFS), OS and one to five year survival rates compared to the previous standard of care. These results led to FDA approval of TTFields for newly diagnosed GBM and were acknowledged since then by several guidelines recommending TTFields for GBM therapy (e.g. NCCN guidelines for CNS cancers V.1.2018, RCC guideline tum?rer I hj?rna och ryggm?rg 2020-01-14 V3.0, DGHO guideline for glioma in adults ICD-10 C71 March 2019). Today, several national committees in Europe already list TTFields as reimbursed treatment (e.g. Austria, Sweden, Germany).  Data with TTFields therapy in real-world setting is limited and therefore further evaluation of different treatment aspects of TTFields therapy in clinical routine are of interest. In particular the QoL-related aspects neurocognitive functioning, daily activity and sleep quality in this patient cohort is of major interest, given the limited life expectancy with this disease.  This non-interventional study aims to investigate change over time in neurocognitive functioning, sleep quality, and activity in daily life as important determinants of QoL in a large cohort of GBM patients in Germany treated with TTFields in routine clinical care using low-threshold, electronic PRO and modern automated tracking data analyses. The gained results will allow even better understanding of TTFields therapy in daily life of GBM patients and consequently, better informing patients about what to expect when starting this therapy, increasing therapy compliance even further in the long-term."

546,MK-3475 in Combination With MRI-guided Laser Ablation in Recurrent Malignant Gliomas,NCT02311582,"The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle to drug delivery in the treatment of malignant brain tumors including Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MRI-guided laser ablation (MLA) has been noted to disrupt peritumoral BBB, which could then lead to increased access of new tumor antigens to the lymphovascular system and vice versa of immune effector cells to the tumor for effective activation of the immune system. Therefore the combination of MK-3475 and MLA as proposed in this protocol is hypothesized to create a therapeutic synergy in which MLA increases material access to promote immune activation and then MK-3475 maximizes these tumor-specific immune reactions to impart effective tumor control."

The patient will be given a single injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. The injection will take between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for 1 to 4 hours. If later the subject seems to be experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms), s/he may be able to receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if they wish. These additional infusions would be at least 6 to 12 weeks apart and at the same dose level received the first time.  Medical tests before treatment--  Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests as follows: Physical exam, Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function, Routine heart function tests (Echocardiogram),Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies  Medical tests during and after treatment--  The patient will receive standard medical tests when getting the infusions and after:Physical exams, Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function, Routine heart function tests (Echocardiogram) at 6 weeks after the infusion, Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies 6 weeks after the infusion  To learn more about the way the HER2-CAR CMV-T cells are working and how long they last in the body, blood will be taken on the day of the T-cell infusion, before, 1 hour and 4 hours after the T-cell infusion, 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the T-cell infusion and every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years."
549,Multi-site Validation and Application of a Consensus DSC-MRI Protocol,NCT03401866,"Although DSC-MRI itself is not novel, the consensus protocol tested herein is newly developed in response to a stated need by federal agencies (FDA, NCI) for standardization of imaging endpoints, including perfusion-weighted MRI, in multi-center clinical trials of GBM therapies. Through use of stereotactic methodologies that have been used to demonstrate that rCBV(relative cerebral blood flow) and FTB(fractional tumor burden) measures made by the consensus DSC-MRI protocol are concordant with tissue histology, this multi-site trial will be the first to validate a consensus DSC-MRI protocol on multiple platforms representing all major MRI scanner manufacturers. The trial also formally compares two contrast agent dosing schemes proposed in the consensus protocol, a single-dose BTIP-compliant scheme and a double-dose scheme. Such a comparison has never been tested in patients before, and addresses a longstanding controversy regarding contrast agent administration and dosing for DSC-MRI. Successful validation of the consensus DSC-MRI protocol will likely shift clinical practice paradigms. To date, the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI has been limited by inconsistent published methodologies, rCBV thresholds, and impact on clinical decision making. This trial seeks to improve confidence in DSCMRI methodology as it will foster its adoption for multicenter trials, facilitating the development and testing of novel therapeutic agents and treatment strategies for GBM, and shift clinical practice paradigms by providing strong evidence to support the inclusion of DSC-MRI in established response assessment criteria (i.e., modified RANO)."

Bevacizumab (BEV), an antiangiogenic anti-VEGF-R monoclonal antibody, has a rapid impact on tumor-related brain edema in recurrent GB. The present study reports the feasibility and efficacy of an induction treatment with TMZ and BEV to alleviate the initial neurological impairment and/or to reduce the tumor volume before a delayed chemoradiotherapy.  The investigators retrospectively analyzed tumor and target volumes and clinical neurological status in 39 patients with bulky GB and/or with severe neurological impairment after an induction treatment combining TMZ and BEV. Neurological and radiological responses were assessed according to RANO criteria.  Calculating gross tumor and clinical target volumes (GTV and CTV) was done at diagnosis and before radiotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined by Kaplan Meier methods. Safety was reported according to NCTCAE."
552,"Cetuximab, Bevacizumab and Irinotecan for Patients With Malignant Glioblastomas",NCT00463073,"Irinotecan has demonstrated activity in malignant gliomas in multiple phase II studies. The activity is limited, with an approximately 15 % response rate and a progression-free survival of 3-5 months. Given the synergy between irinotecan and bevacizumab in colorectal cancer, and the high-level expression of vascular endothelial growth factor on malignant gliomas, one would expect synergy between bevacizumab and irinotecan against gliomas. In addition, 40-50 % of GBM have EGFR amplification/mutation making the EGFR an additional target. By combing cetuximab, with irinotecan and bevacizumab, one would expect further response, than irinotecan and bevacizumab alone. In addition, recurrent gliomas have an extremely poor prognosis, so innovative therapies are needed."
553,Contribution of Cerebral 18F-DOPA PET-CT Scan in High-grade Recurrent Gliomas,NCT04766632,"The use of contrast enhancement in enhancing -T1 MRI, due to the rupture of the blood-brain barrier may underestimate the volume to be irradiated. The natural course of these gliomas after first irradiation is a second relapse within 12 months with, in 40% of cases, relapses outside the initial radiation field.  Amino acid PET-CT (Positon Emission Tomography with Computed Tomography) could be an interesting alternative to tumor delineation because its results, do not depend on the rupture of the blood-brain barrier. Several studies have used amino acid PET in the planning of radiotherapy treatment for high-grade gliomas, but without a well-conducted prospective study. In the recurrent high-grade glioma population, no studies have been performed with 18F-DOPA.( 6-fluoro-[18F]-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) The question therefore relates to the interest of cerebral 18F-DOPA PET-CT to improve the delineation of the volumes to be re-irradiated, during the recurrence of high-grade gliomas, and on the optimal methodology for determining GTV- PET.  To compare GTV-TEP and GTV-MRI volumes with each other, and the r-GTV, volume corresponding to the relapse objectified on the follow-up MRI, the analysis will be based on 3 parameters:  DICE index, similarity index between 2 volumes, Contoured Common Volume (VCC), intersection of 2 volumes between them, Additional Contoured Volume (VSC), total volume delineated with imaging minus the common volume between 2 imageries.  Thus, within the rGTV relapse volume, it's important to know whether VSC of 18F-DOPA PET-CT is significant compared to that of MRI and would thus allow better definition of the volumes to be irradiated."

556,Temozolomide Plus Bevacizumab in Supratentorial Glioblastoma in 70 Years and Older Patients With an Impaired Functional Status,NCT02898012,"Elderly patients aged 65 years and older account for approximately 45% of GBM patients, and this figure is expected to rise concurrently with the aging population of most countries. Unfortunately, few trials have been performed in this setting. In elderly patients with good functional status (KPS >70), radiotherapy (RT) prolongs overall survival (OS) without causing a detriment in quality of life compared with palliative care alone. Recently, it was shown that TMZ could be an alternative to RT. In elderly patients with poor functional status at symptom onset (KPS < 70), RT does not appear to be a satisfactory option in this frail population; however, investigators previously found that TMZ alone was associated with improvements in functional status in 1/3 of cases and appeared to increase survival compared with supportive care alone, especially in methylated MGMT promoter patients.  Bevacizumab (Bev) is an antiangiogenic monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) that is currently used in recurrent GBM, particularly in combination with alkylating agents. Its effect as first line treatment in combination with TMZ and RT is controversial.  In this study, investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of the upfront combination of TMZ + Bev as an initial treatment for elderly patients with GBM and impaired functional status (KPS <70)."
557,Ph I SU011248 + Irinotecan in Treatment of Pts w MG,NCT00611728,"Primary interest for combining SU011248 w irinotecan in malignant glioma pts derives from dramatic anti-tumor activity recently demonstrated among RMG pts treated w humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, when combined w irinotecan. 63 percent radiographic response rate was observed following treatment w regimen every other wk, & median progression-free survival was 23wks. Similar enhancement of chemo activity by VEGF-directed therapy w bev has been previously demonstrated for colorectal & lung cancer pts. SU011248 is being evaluated in current regimen because it may exert more potent anti-angiogenic effect than bev among MG pts due to its ability to inhibit PDGFR-mediated pericyte stabilization in tumor neovasculature.  Current proposed ph I study is designed to determine MTD & DLT of SU011248 when combo w irinotecan for pts w RMG. Both SU01148 & irinotecan are known to be metabolized by CYP3A4 cytochrome system.

558,Phase I Study of Mebendazole Therapy for Recurrent/Progressive Pediatric Brain Tumors,NCT02644291,"The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral mebendazole in patients with recurrent/progressive pediatric brain tumors and to confirm the tolerance of the MTD of oral mebendazole by assessing tolerance in a dose expansion cohort. Secondary Objectives of the study include to determine the safety, tolerability and toxicity of mebendazole in this patient population, determine the plasma levels of mebendazole in this patient population and Determine progression-free and overall survival of mebendazole in an extended cohort of patients with treatment refractory pediatric brain cancer.  Mebendazole (MBZ) is a drug developed to treat human helminthic disease and is FDA-approved for the treatment of roundworm, common hookworm, American hookworm, pinworm and whipworm. MBZ use is well documented and frequently used in tropical countries at higher doses for the rarer parasitic infections of the brain.  We have shown efficacy in preclinical laboratory models of high grade glioma and medulloblastoma. Mebendazole therapy demonstrated safety in a phase I clinical trial for adults with high grade gliomas such as glioblastoma. This trial completed the maximum approved enrollment of 24 patients treated with mebendazole, with high doses consistent with dosing published for severe parasitic infections.  Laboratory studies indicate that mebendazole enters the brain and brain tumors at concentrations that may be effective for a combination of anti-cancer mechanisms. In animal models of brain cancer evidence suggest that mebendazole can prevent cell proliferation by interfering with tubulin formation, and it may prevent the formation of new abnormal blood vessels that feed tumor growth.  The patients for this experimental trial are those between the age of 1 to 21 with the diagnosis of medulloblastoma, or high grade glioma, where the tumor has resumed growth or continued to grow despite standard medical therapy. High grade glioma are those with a World Health Organization (WHO) grade of III or IV. It includes diagnosis of pediatric glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Patients who have failed other forms of experimental therapy may also be eligible for this trial.  Mebendazole is provided at no cost in the form of a chewable 500 mg tablets, recommended to be taken three times daily with meals or food. The pill can be chewed after meals, or ground up to be mixed with food or drink. It has a mild orange flavor that is similar in consistency to an antacid tablet.  Although side effects are rare and the vast majority are reversible, they include stomach upset, decreased blood count, and elevated liver enzymes due to inflammation.  The main additional procedure beyond taking this drug, is that patients are requested to consent to up to three additional blood draws to check the blood (serum) levels of the drug to ensure it is being absorbed at sufficient doses.  Patients can continue to receive the drug as long as in the attending physicians opinion the therapy is not causing any severe side effects, and there is no clear indication that the patient will not respond to mebendazole therapy. Patients can withdraw from this trial at any time for any reason, and may be eligible for other experimental therapies afterwards."

In these trials, high doses (up to 3 x 10^9 plaque-forming units) of virus were safely injected directly into the tumor or surrounding brain tissue without serious toxicities. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence of an antitumor response was seen in some patients. Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that a variety of aggressive pediatric brain tumor types are sensitive to G207.  A Phase I study of intratumoral G207 alone or combined with a 5 Gy dose of radiation in children ages 3-18 with biopsy-confirmed recurrent/progressive supratentorial brain tumors recently completed the highest planned dose level (UAB1472; NCT02457845). The study used a 3 + 3 design with 4 dose cohorts.12 Patients underwent stereotactic placement of up to 4 intratumoral catheters. The following day they received a single controlled-rate infusion of G207 (1 x 10^7 or 1 x 10^8 pfu) over 6 hours. Cohorts 3 and 4 received a 5 Gy radiation fraction to the gross tumor volume within 24 hours of G207. Twelve subjects with progressive high-grade glioma received G207. Twenty adverse events, all grade 1, were attributed to G207. G207 was determined to be safe and tolerable in children and a recommended Phase 2 was established (1 x10^8 followed by 5 Gy radiation to the tumor).  This study is a phase II, open-label, single arm clinical trial of G207 alone or combined with a single low dose of radiation in children with recurrent or progressive high grade glioma. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy. The secondary objective is to confirm the safety and tolerability of G207 and to survey for virologic shedding following G207.  Subjects will receive G207 at 1 x 10^8 plaque-forming units (pfu), intratumorally via controlled rate infusion through up to 4 silastic catheters over a 6 hour period. The subject will then receive a single 5 Gy dose of radiation to the tumor within 24 hours of virus inoculation."
561,Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioma,NCT00006773,"OBJECTIVES:  I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib with or without anticonvulsant drugs known to be metabolized by the P450 hepatic enzyme complex in patients with recurrent glioma.  II. Determine the biologic activity of this drug by measuring proteasome 20S activity in these patients.  III. Determine the effects of hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs, such as anticonvulsants, on biologic activity of this drug in these patients.  OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent anticonvulsant drug use (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, or felbamate vs gabapentin, lamotrigine, valproic acid, or no anticonvulsant drugs).  Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly for 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional patients are treated with bortezomib at the MTD. Patients are followed every 2 months."
562,Ribociclib (LEE011) in Preoperative Glioma and Meningioma Patients,NCT02933736,"900 mg/d is the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), as determined in a recent Novartis-sponsored Phase I study for advanced solid tumor patients. The recommended dose expansion and Phase 2 is 600mg/d for 3 weeks on and 1 week off. Due to drug pharmacokinetics, the MTD (900mg) dose will be used for pre-surgical dosing in order to maximize the opportunity to identify relevant tumor pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) endpoints.  To assess the PK, and PD endpoints listed above, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tumor tissue will be collected intraoperatively (for gliomas, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor tissue will be collected and analyzed separately). Additionally, blood samples will be obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the final ribociclib dose is administered.  Patients with tumors demonstrating positive PK and PD effects will continue treatment with ribociclib (21 days on, 7 days off) after surgery. This will constitute the Phase II component of the study. Patients will be treated until unacceptable toxicity is observed, or until disease progression as assessed by radiographic or clinical metrics. Preliminary rates of progression-free survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas treated with ribociclib will be measured through radiographic and clinical response metrics, specifically Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and investigator discretion. Overall survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas treated with ribociclib will be assessed by medical record review and survival follow up."

565,INCB7839 in Treating Children With Recurrent/Progressive High-Grade Gliomas,NCT04295759,"INCB7839 is an inhibitor of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease) 10 and 17 proteases. Neuronal activity regulates glioma growth through neuroligin-3 (NLGN3). ADAM 10 is the protease responsible for NLGN3 release into the tumor microenvironment and represents a promising therapeutic target.  Pre-clinical studies of INCB7839 in patient-derived pediatric high-grade gliomas (GBM and DIPG) revealed that INCB7839 inhibits pediatric high- grade glioma growth and improves overall survival. In vivo testing also demonstrated that INCB7839 penetrates brain tissue sufficient to achieve its pharmacodynamic effect of ADAM10 inhibition. Further pre-clinical studies in other animals revealed minimal toxicity, including non-adverse to mild increases in serum hepatobiliary enzymes, protein, calcium, cholesterol values, along with minimal decreases in RBC mass parameters; all parameters recovered.  INCB7839 has been evaluated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for previously treated solid tumors and breast cancer. Of the adverse events (AEs) noted, the majority were mild-to-moderate in severity, the most frequent being fatigue, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, emesis, abdominal pain, anemia and constipation. The dose-limiting toxicity for monotherapy with INCB7839 in Phase I clinical trials was declared to be deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Out of 41 patients, there was a total of 9 thrombotic events including mild superficial thrombophlebitis (n=1), DVT (n=4), vena cava thrombosis with renal insufficiency in a patient with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (n=1), atrial thrombosis in patient with breast cancer (n=1), and pulmonary embolism in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (n=2). Overall, INCB7839 does exhibit a pro-coagulant effect in some adult patients, resulting in an increased incidence of DVT, whether used alone or in combination. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, and there is no clear relationship between the frequency of thrombosis and the dose administered."
566,Imaging Study of the Distribution of IL13-PE38QQR Infused Before and After Surgery in Adult Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma,NCT00064779,"OBJECTIVES:  Assess the distribution of IL13-PE38QQR following continuous infusion via catheter(s) into recurrent malignant glioma prior to surgical resection and a continuous infusion via catheter(s) into brain tissue adjacent to tumor resection site after surgical resection. 123I-HSA tracer will be used as a surrogate for study drug distribution. Determine the toxicities associated with administration of IL13-PE38QQR as described above. Assess the effect on distribution of IL13-PE38QQR of varying the catheter type (up to 3) and flow rate per catheter, keeping the total flow rates constant, for the pre- and post-resection infusions.  OUTLINE: This is a pilot study to assess the distribution of IL13-PE38QQR delivered by intratumoral infusion prior to surgical resection and by interstitial infusion into tissue surrounding the resection site (peritumoral) after surgical resection. Prior to resection, catheters will be placed in the region of the solid contrast-enhancing tumor component. The volume of infusion, the duration of infusion, and the concentration of IL13-PE38QQR in the infusate will be fixed. For the post-resection infusion, catheters will be placed peritumorally into areas at greatest risk for residual or infiltrating tumor. The post-resection volume of infusion, the duration of infusion, and the concentration of IL13-PE38QQR in the infusate will be fixed. For the first 48 hours of each infusion, IL13-PE38QQR will be prepared with 123I-HSA tracer as the surrogate for distribution of study drug. The type and number of catheters utilized to deliver the pre- and post-surgery infusions will vary. To maintain a fixed total volume of infusate over 96 hours, the rate of infusion will vary depending upon the number of catheters utilized. Up to three different catheter types will be tested. However, only the same, single type of catheter will be utilized for the pre- and post-resection infusions for a given patient.  To allow assessment of the distribution of the infused material, the first 48 hours of both the pre- and post-resection infusions will utilize 123I-HSA in the infusate. For the last 48 hours of both infusions, the 123I-HSA will be replaced by non-labeled HSA. The distribution of the 123I-HSA tracer will be measured by Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scanning.  PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 18 patients will be enrolled at a single site."

Determine the concentration of IL13-PE38QQR that produces histologic evidence of toxicity to tumor, and the corresponding drug toxicity, following a 2-day continuous infusion into recurrent malignant glioma prior to surgical resection.  II. Determine the toxicity of IL13-PE38QQR administered as a 4-day continuous infusion via catheters into brain adjacent to tumor resection site, after surgical resection, at concentrations up to the selected concentration.  III. Determine the toxicity of increasing duration of continuous infusion of IL13- PE38QQR via catheters into brain adjacent to tumor resection site, after surgical resection, at the selected concentration.  IV. Determine the feasibility and safety of IL13-PE38QQR administration following post-operative placement of stereotaxic catheters 2 days after tumor resection, utilizing a post-operative imaging study for planning of catheter placement. A 4-day continuous infusion at the MTD is planned.  V. Describe the time to progression and survival of patients treated with IL13-PE38QQR.  PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This study is designed to determine two dose levels. The first is defined as the histologically effective concentration (HEC) when the agent is administered prior to tumor resection. The second is defined using safety and tolerability of study drug administered after tumor resection at doses up to the HEC. Safety and tolerability of increasing duration of infusion after tumor resection will then be assessed.  Patient cohorts will be treated at escalating pre-resection dose-levels until a stopping criterion for the pre-surgery dose is met, holding the post-resection dose constant at the starting level. Stopping criteria for dose escalation of the pre-surgery infusion are determination of the HEC or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  Subsequent cohorts will be treated only post-operatively at escalating dose levels until a stopping criterion for the post-surgery dose is met. Stopping criteria for dose escalation of the post-surgery infusion are reaching the HEC determined for the pre-operative infusion or determination of the MTD. After the HEC is reached, subsequent cohorts will be treated with post-operative infusions of increasing duration at the HEC until the maximum duration defined in the study is reached or an MTD is defined. (If an MTD has already detected, duration will not be escalated.)  After the stage of the study evaluating escalation of infusion duration has completed, the study will expand to evaluate post-operative placement of catheters after tumor resection. This stage of the study will assess the feasibility and safety of stereotaxic placement of catheters 2 days after tumor resection using a post-operative imaging study for planning. Patients will receive a 96 hour post-resection infusion at the MTD.  Cohorts of at least three patients will be entered at each dose level. Each cohort will be observed for at least thirty days after completion of administration of study drug to allow for observation of toxicity before the next cohort is enrolled.  PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Depends on number of dose-levels, estimated at 25-50 patients."

573,TTFields In GErmany in Routine Clinical Care,NCT03258021,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary tumor of the brain. The current standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal surgical resection, approx. 60 Gy of radiotherapy together with chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ), followed by maintenance TMZ for 6 months. This treatment scheme was shown to extend median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months compared to surgery and radiotherapy alone. This survival was essentially unchanged since 2005 despite numerous clinical Phase 3 trials conducted.  Although immense efforts were made over the years with different treatment strategies, the survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM remained very poor until recently. Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) are low-intensity, intermediate frequency, alternating electric fields delivered continuously through adhesive patches, called transducer arrays, to the area of the brain where the GBM tumor is located and help slow down or stop glioblastoma cancer cells from dividing. These transducer arrays are applied to the scalp and are connected to the wearable and portable device.  TTFields are the first treatment since 2005 to demonstrate significantly extended median overall survival and significantly improved long-term survival (one to five year survival rates) compared to the current standard of care. In addition, TTFields significantly extended progression-free survival.  In the Phase 3 trial in newly diagnosed GBM (trial EF-14) the results demonstrated that the addition of TTFields to maintenance TMZ significantly extends both, median and long term survival, as well as progression free survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The magnitude of survival benefit seen is even better to that seen for addition of TMZ to radiation, which established TMZ as the standard of care for 1st line GBM treatment in 2005. Quality of life (QoL) was maintained with the use of TTFields + TMZ in patients for whom 12 months of QoL data were available. The addition of TTFields to TMZ therapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma was not associated with any significant increase in systemic toxic effects compared with TMZ therapy alone. The most commonly reported side effect from the delivery of TTFields was a mild-to-moderate skin irritation beneath the transducer arrays."

576,Super-selective Intra-arterial Repeated Infusion of Cetuximab for the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma,NCT02861898,"Primary brain cancer kills up to 10,000 Americans a year. These brain tumors are typically treated by surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either individually or in combination. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months. Glioma is the most common form of primary brain cancer, afflicting approximately 7,000 patients in the United States each year. These highly malignant cancers remain a significant unmet clinical need in oncology. GBM often has a high expression EFGR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) which is blocked by Cetuximab (CTX). The investigators have recently completed a separate Phase I clinical trial using superselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion (SIACI) of CTX after blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD) for recurrent GBM (Chakraborty et al, in revision, Journal of Neurooncology). The investigators found that intra-arterial infusion of CTX is well tolerated with few adverse effects. The investigators hypothesize that in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, repeated SIACI of this drug after BBBD will be safe and efficacious for our patients when combined with standard chemoradiation (STUPP protocol).  This trial will be a non-randomized open label Phase I/II clinical trial. In addition to standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy (STUPP protocol) the patient will be given CTX intra-arterially after BBBD for a total of three doses at approximately post surgery days 30, 120 and 210."

583,FDG and FDOPA PET Demonstration of Functional Brain Abnormalities,NCT04315584,"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:  I. The primary objective will be to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Dynamic PET imaging in differentiating tumor recurrence from treatment effect (radiation necrosis or pseudoprogression) in patients previously treated with chemo-radiation therapy for primary high grade gliomas. This will be accomplished by examining the concordance between the Dynamic PET imaging prediction and the criterion standard, which will be based on either surgical pathology or an integrated clinical/MRI determination within a 3-6 month interval after Dynamic PET imaging.  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:  I. The diagnostic accuracy of Static PET imaging, advanced MRI, and advanced MRI + Dynamic PET imaging in differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation-induced necrosis in high grade glioma patients will be examined in the same exact way as just outlined for Dynamic PET imaging.  OUTLINE:  Subjects receive 18FDG (first scan) and (18)F-FDOPA (2-14 days from the first scan) intravenously (IV) slowly over a period of 15-20 seconds and then undergo dynamic PET scans over a period of 60-90 minutes. CT scans on the subjects are performed before the dynamic PET scans for 5 minutes. Subjects also undergo MRI brain examinations just prior to the FDOPA scan over a period of 1 hour, which includes T1 weighed, T1 weighted contrast enhanced, T2 weighted, Diffusion tensor imaging, MR spectroscopy, and Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion weighted (DSC-PWI) imaging."
584,Study of IDO Inhibitor and Temozolomide for Adult Patients With Primary Malignant Brain Tumors,NCT02052648,"The aim of this study is to identify the safety profile and the recommended dose for phase 2 study of the combination of indoximod (portion 1, phase 1b study). Investigators will then evaluate the tolerability and the preliminary activity in patients with recurrent GBM in three different situations:  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide (bevacizumab-naive patients) Combination of indoximod and temozolomide in patients currently receiving or having received and failed bevacizumab. Combination of indoximod and temozolomide with stereotactic radiation. Ancillary studies will be conducted to assess the correlation between intra-tumoral IDO expression or serum biomarkers (immune monitoring) and treatment efficacy.  If the current study shows an acceptable safety profile and suggests preliminary evidence of activity, this will provide the justification for subsequent randomized phase 2 studies in refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)."
585,HSV G207 Alone or With a Single Radiation Dose in Children With Progressive or Recurrent Supratentorial Brain Tumors,NCT02457845,"Outcomes for children with recurrent or progressive supratentorial malignant brain tumors are very poor, and there are a lack of effective salvage therapies once a patient fails standard treatments.  G207 is an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV) that has been successfully engineered to introduce mutations in the virus that enable it to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells, but not normal cells. Replication of G207 in the tumor not only kills the infected tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus engenders an anti-tumor immune response; the virus is immunogenic and produces a debris field which exposes cancer cell antigens to immune cells which can target other cancer cells. Thus, the oncolytic effect of the virus and the immune response that the virus stimulates provide a one-two punch at attacking cancer cells. In preclinical studies, a single 5 Gy dose of radiation within 24 hours of virus inoculation to the tumor increased virus replication and tumor cell killing.  The University of Alabama at Birmingham has conducted three phase I trials of G207 injected into the recurrent tumor alone or combined with a single dose of radiation in adults with recurrent high-grade gliomas. In these trials, high doses (up to 3 x 10^9 plaque-forming units) of virus were safely injected directly into the tumor or surrounding brain tissue without serious toxicities. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence of an antitumor response was seen in some patients. Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that a variety of aggressive pediatric brain tumor types are sensitive to G207.  This study is a phase I, open-label, single institution clinical trial of G207 alone or combined with a single low dose of radiation in children with recurrent or progressive supratentorial brain tumors. The primary goal is to determine safety. The secondary aims are to obtain preliminary information on the effectiveness of and immune response to G207.  A traditional 3 + 3 design will be used with four patient cohorts. The first two cohorts will receive G207 at one of two doses, and the second two cohorts will receive G207 at one of two doses followed by a 5 Gy dose of radiation."
586,"Genetically Modified Neural Stem Cells, Flucytosine, and Leucovorin for Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas",NCT02015819,"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:  I. To define the phase II recommended dose of intracerebrally administered cytosine deaminase (CD)-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs) in combination with oral 5-fluorocytosine (FC) (flucytosine) and leucovorin.  II. To determine the feasibility of treating study patients with more than 1 dose of NSCs followed by 7-day courses of 5-FC and leucovorin.  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:  I. To assess for possible development of NSC immunogenicity (anti-NSC T cell and/or antibody response) with repeat doses of NSCs.  II. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of 5-FC and 5-FU at the maximum tolerated dose/maximum feasible dose level.  III.
