0,"Delivery of molecularly targeted therapy to malignant glioma, a disease of the whole brain","The past two decades have witnessed major advances in molecular and cellular biology that have substantially improved our understanding of human malignancies. Unfortunately, this period has also seen a significant rise in the incidence of malignant brain tumours along with only a modest increase in the survival rates associated with them, which are often poor (Ref. 1). Out of the approximately 22 020 new cases of primary malignant brain tumours that were estimated to be diagnosed in the USA in 2010, 80% were expected to be malignant gliomas (Refs 2, 3). Gliomas represent a group of highly malignant and lethal tumours of the brain that, despite all therapeutic advances, have an extremely poor prognosis. The median survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most malignant subtype of glioma, is only 12-18 months (Ref. 4). The current standard of care in glioblastoma multiforme is treatment with the DNA-alkylating agent temozolomide combined with radiation, a treatment that has been proven to prolong patient survival by a few months (Ref. 4). Many new molecularly targeted agents that were developed to inhibit signalling pathways critical for glioma growth and proliferation have failed to elicit any clinical benefit (Ref. 5).","Glioblastoma multiforme, because of its invasive nature, can be considered a disease of the entire brain. Despite recent advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, current treatment regimens have only a marginal impact on patient survival. A crucial challenge is to deliver drugs effectively to invasive glioma cells residing in a sanctuary within the central nervous system. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the delivery of many small and large molecules into the brain. Drug delivery to the brain is further restricted by active efflux transporters present at the BBB. Current clinical assessment of drug delivery and hence efficacy is based on the measured drug levels in the bulk tumour mass that is usually removed by surgery. Mounting evidence suggests that the inevitable relapse and lethality of glioblastoma multiforme is due to a failure to effectively treat invasive glioma cells. These invasive cells hide in areas of the brain that are shielded by an intact BBB, where they continue to grow and give rise to the recurrent tumour. Effective delivery of chemotherapeutics to the invasive glioma cells is therefore critical, and long-term efficacy will depend on the ability of a molecularly targeted agent to penetrate an intact and functional BBB throughout the entire brain. This review highlights the various aspects of the BBB, and also the brain-tumour-cell barrier (a barrier due to expression of efflux transporters in tumour cells), that together can significantly influence drug response. It then discusses the challenge of glioma as a disease of the whole brain, which lends emphasis to the need to deliver drugs effectively across the BBB to reach both the central tumour and the invasive glioma cells.",https//www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/45B082815504D678D70CAB70E3AABB0F/S1462399411001888a.pdf/div-class-title-delivery-of-molecularly-targeted-therapy-to-malignant-glioma-a-disease-of-the-whole-brain-div.pdf
43,New Multitarget Approaches in the War Against Glioblastoma A Mini-Perspective,"Despite the recent advantages in the field of drug design, the development of innovative and selective single-target drugs seems to be a task of little success, at least in the field of anticancer drug research. Too often, therapies properly designed to act selectively against a single-target display a low or no efficacy. Indeed, the cellular processes cannot be effectively modulated by a single-target drug and this weakness can be attributed to the complexity of pathways and molecular alterations implicated in the development and progression of cancer. The most tangible evidence of the failure of one-drug-one-target therapy is observed in tumor forms that are particularly refractory and resistant to chemotherapies, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM is the most common tumor of the CNS and it is considered as the deadliest form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 4%  . Moreover, the average survival rate in GBM patients undergoing maximum safe surgical resection is approximately only 14 months. When surgery is followed by adjuvant postoperative multimodal therapy, including both chemo-and radiotherapy with conventional cytotoxic agents (Delgado-López and Corrales-García, 2016), the resulting life expectation increases to about 5 years. Such a poor prognosis for GBM has been related to various factors, such as the rapid onset of the disease, cancer location, and a deficient knowledge of the pathophysiology  , that limit the availability of efficient therapeutic tools, thus highlighting the urgency to find novel efficacious treatments.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common tumor of the CNS, and the deadliest form of brain cancer. The rapid progression, the anatomic location in the brain and a deficient knowledge of the pathophysiology, often limit the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Current pillars of GBM therapies include surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but the low survival rate and the short life expectation following these treatments strongly underline the urgency to identify innovative and more effective therapeutic tools. Frequently, patients subjected to a mono-target therapy, such as Temozolomide (TMZ), develop drug resistance and undergo relapse, indicating that targeting a single cellular node is not sufficient for eradication of this disease. In this context, a multi-targeted therapeutic approach aimed at using compounds, alone or in combination, capable of inhibiting more than one specific molecular target, offers a promising alternative. Such strategies have already been well integrated into drug discovery campaigns, including in the field of anticancer drugs. In this miniperspective, we will discuss the recent progress in the treatment of GBM focusing on innovative and effective preclinical strategies, which are based on a multi-targeted approach.",https//fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/388950/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fphar-09-00874/fphar-09-00874.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=8JWArzH043weBh0UAXyItmCYri8abqRdIxccoEVe6ZY%3D&se=2021-03-02T02%3A32%3A19Z&sp=r&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27fphar-09-00874.pdf
69,The Diagnostic and Therapeutic Role of Leptin and Its Receptor ObR in Glioblastoma Multiforme,"In addition to its canonical role in immune-metabolic signaling (satiety and weight loss/gain), leptin is well-known to promote cellular proliferation, survival and migration through its associated receptor (ObR) and related pathways under physiological conditions, as well as during the initiation and progression of cancers of different organ systems (breast, lung, prostate, brain). Leptin/ObR activities have been characterized as anti-apoptotic, proliferative and potentially pro-angiogenetic   . In particular, data from experimental (in vivo and in vitro) and human studies indicate that the leptin/ObR axis and its degree of expression may differ depending on brain tumor grade     . For instance, compared to low-grade gliomas and other brain tumor entities, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells display a relatively high leptin and ObR expression profile, suggesting a role for the leptin/ObR ratio in the development and recurrence of high-grade, aggressive gliomas (glioblastoma; cell growth, invasion, migration)  .","Despite recent advances in molecular brain tumor therapies, glioblastoma multiforme remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge with, in most cases, unfavorable outcome. Leptin and related mediators of immune-metabolic traffic have attracted increased recognition in the past decade in brain tumor biology, in particular potential implications in the diagnosis and treatment of recurrent and newly diagnosed high and low grade gliomas. Randomized controlled trails are on the way to elaborate the role of leptin and its receptor ObR by targeting and using antidiabetic drugs known to interact with distinct pathways associated with leptin signaling. To date, most of the findings in clinical studies remain preliminary and of heterogenous character, although experimental studies have underpinned the relevance of leptin and ObR in the pathophysiology of brain tumors in general.Leptin has been recognized as a potential tumor growth promoter in various cancers including cranial tumor pathologies such as pituitary adenomas, meningiomas and gliomas. Despite recent advances in adjunctive therapy and the established surgical resection, chemo- and radiotherapy regimen, glioblastoma multiforme remains a particular diagnostic and therapeutic challenge among the intracranial tumor pathologies, with a poor long-term prognosis. Systemic inflammation and immune-metabolic signaling through diverse pathways are thought to impact the genesis and recurrence of brain tumors, and glioblastoma multiforme in particular. Among the various circulating mediators, leptin has gained especial diagnostic and therapeutic interest, although the precise relationship between leptin and glioblastoma biology remains largely unknown. In this narrative review (MEDLINE/OVID, SCOPUS, PubMed and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles), we discuss the current literature using the following search terms leptin, glioblastoma multiforme, carcinogenesis, immunometabolism, biomarkers, metformin, antidiabetic medication and metabolic disorders. An increasing body of experimental evidence implicates a relationship between the development and maintenance of gliomas (and brain tumors in general) with a dysregulated central and peripheral immune-metabolic network mediated by circulating adipokines, chemokines and cellular components, and in particular the leptin adipokine. In this review, we summarize the current evidence of the role of leptin in glioblastoma pathophysiology. In addition, we describe the status of alternative diagnostic tools and adjunctive therapeutics targeting leptin, leptin-receptors, antidiabetic drugs and associated pathways. Further experimental and clinical trials are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action and the value of immune-metabolism molecular phenotyping (central and peripheral) in order to develop novel adjunctive diagnostics and therapeutics for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma patients.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/cancers/cancers-12-03691/article_deploy/cancers-12-03691.pdf
101,Phase I/pharmacokinetic study of CCI-779 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma on enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs,"Treatment options are limited for patients with malignant glioma recurring despite radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy with either a nitrosourea or temozolomide  . Recent advances in the understanding of molecular and cytogenetic pathways involved in gliomagenesis, tumor growth, and invasion have led to the rational targeting of aberrant molecular pathways. A significant proportion of glioblastoma mul-tiforme (GBM) have altered PTEN gene-suppression activity  , which results in the increased activity of the phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. This in turn activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), thereby increasing translation of a number of key proteins required for cell-cycle progression. The presence of PTEN gene alterations and the subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway have been associated with poor prognosis in anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and GBM    . Restoration of PTEN function or targeting of the components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways can result in cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or reduced tumorigenicity and are rational targets for clinical evaluation.","s CCI-779 is an ester of the immunosuppressive agent sirolimus ( rapamycin) that causes cell-cycle arrest at G1 via inhibition of key signaling pathways resulting in inhibition of RNA translation. Antitumor activity has been demonstrated using cell lines and animal models of malignant glioma. Patients receiving enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) can have altered metabolism of drugs like CCI-779 that are metabolized through the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The objectives of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetic profile and the maximum tolerated dose of CCI-779 in patients with recurrent malignant gliioma taking EIAEDs. Study design The starting dose of CCI-779 was 250 mg intravenously (IV) administered weekly on a continuous basis. Standard dose escalation was performed until the maximum tolerated dose was established. Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria.  Two of 6 patients treated at the second dose level of 330 mg sustained a dose-limiting toxicity grade III stomatitis, grade 3 hypercholesterolemia, or grade 4 hypertriglyceridemia. The maximum tolerated dose was reached at 250 mg IV. Pharmacokinetic profiles were similar to those previously described, but the area under the whole blood concentration-time curve of rapamycin was 1.6 fold lower for patients on EIAEDs.  The recommended phase II dose of CCI 779 for patients on enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs is 250 mg IV weekly. A phase II study is ongoing to determine the efficacy of this agent.",https//deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/45250/10637_2004_Article_5273867.pdf?sequence=1
123,Toxicity evaluation of prolonged convection-enhanced delivery of small-molecule kinase inhibitors in naive rat brainstem,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are inoperable and lethal high-grade gliomas that account for 75-80 % of pediatric brainstem gliomas  . The current standard of care for DIPG is radiation therapy and despite numerous efforts to improve treatment, the prognosis for DIPG remains poor, with median survival of shorter than 1 year  .","Convection-enhanced delivery (CED), a local drug delivery technique, is typically performed as a single session and drug concentrations therefore decline quickly post CED. Prolonged CED (pCED) overcomes this problem by performing a long-term infusion to maintain effective drug concentrations for an extended period. The purpose of the current study was to assess the toxicity of using pCED to deliver single and multi-drug therapy in na < ve rat brainstem.Sixteen rats underwent pCED of three small-molecule kinase inhibitors in the pons. Single and multi-drug combinations were delivered continuously for 7 days using ALZET mini-osmotic pumps (model 2001, rate of 1 mu l/h). Rats were monitored daily for neurological signs of toxicity. Rats were sacrificed 10 days post completion of infusion, and appropriate tissue sections were analyzed for histological signs of toxicity.Two rats exhibited signs of neurological deficits, which corresponded with diffuse inflammation, necrosis, and parenchymal damage on histological analysis. The remaining rats showed no neurological or histological signs of toxicity.The neurological deficits in the two rats were likely due to injury from physical force, such as cannula movement post insertion and subsequent encephalitis. The remaining rats showed no toxicity and therefore brainstem targeting using pCED to infuse single and multi-drug therapy was well tolerated in these rats.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00381-014-2568-3.pdf
145,Phase I study of sorafenib and tipifarnib for recurrent glioblastoma NABTC 05-02,"Primary malignant central nervous system tumors cause more than 13,000 deaths per year in the United States  . The most common as well as the most aggressive primary brain tumor is glioblastoma (GBM). Despite optimal treatment with surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy, almost 90% of patients with GBM will have tumor progression by 2 years  . Second line treatments with either chemotherapies or biological agents usually only achieve a 6-months progression free survival (PFS) in 15-16% of patients with GBM   , and slightly more, 29-45%, if treated with bevacizumab   . Thus, more effective treatments at recurrence are needed.","Recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) has a very low 6-month progression free survival (PFS) with currently available treatments. Combination chemotherapy to target multiple cell signaling pathways is currently being investigated in order to improve prognosis for recurrent disease. The purpose of this phase I study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of tipifarnib and sorafenib for the treatment of recurrent GBM. Patients with pathologically proven WHO grade IV GBM and radiographically proven tumor recurrence were eligible for this study. Treatments included sorafenib at twice daily and escalating dosages of tipifarnib. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was determined over the first 28-days of treatments, and the MTD was determined in a 3 + 3 study design. We enrolled 24 patients, and 21 patients completed the MTD period. The study was stopped early with no MTD determination for excessive toxicities. The last dose level reached was sorafenib at 200 mg twice a day and tipifarnib 100 mg twice a day on an alternating week schedule. The DLTs included diarrhea, lipase elevation, hypophosphatemia, and arthralgia. The combination of sorafenib and tipifarnib has excessive toxicities and full single agent dosages could not be achieved in combination.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-017-2624-4.pdf
172,Systemic rapamycin alone may not be a treatment option for malignant glioma evidence from an in vivo study,"The prognosis for patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), remains very poor despite combined therapeutic modalities, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy   . Because these tumors grow rapidly and invade the surrounding brain parenchyma, it is often impossible to achieve complete surgical resection without causing severe neurologic damage  . Although it is an important therapy for GBM, chemotherapy has not consistently achieved clinical benefits, with significant response in only 10-30% of patients   . Therefore, there is an obvious need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of GBM, such as inhibition of the activities of specific molecular targets that contribute to the malignancy of cancers.","The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a central role in regulating the proliferation of cancer cells, and mTOR-specific inhibitors such as rapamycin analogs are considered as a promising therapy for malignant glioma. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using mTOR inhibitors to treat gliomas. We used a molecular marker, phosphorylation of S6 protein, to monitor biological effects of mTOR inhibitors within xenografts. Phosphorylation was decreased more in U87MG glioma after treatment with high doses of rapamycin or its analog, torisel (10 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg), but only slightly after a low dose of rapamycin (3 mg/kg). This effect correlated with enhanced survival of rats after weekly peritoneal injections of both drugs at the highest two doses but not at the low dose. High doses of both drugs caused weight loss in rats. Clinical trial data indicates that low doses of Torisel (< 3 mg/kg) were not efficacious in recurrent GBM. It is concluded that systemic administration of rapamycin analogues may not be a treatment option for patients with malignant glioma due to the intolerability of high doses that might otherwise be effective. The present study underscores the need for better pre-clinical evaluation of drugs with respect to therapeutic window.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-012-0804-9.pdf
189,The tumorigenic FGFR3-TACC3 gene fusion escapes miR-99a regulation in glioblastoma,"Fusion genes are hybrid genes that form when a chromosomal rearrangement combines parts of 2 genes. Since their original identification in blood cancers (1), fusion genes have been identified in many solid tumors, such as Ewing sarcoma  , synovial sarcoma (3), prostate cancer   , lung cancer   , breast cancer  , and ovarian cancer  . Gene fusions can lead to the production of oncogenic fusion proteins, such as the constitutively active BCR-ABL1 kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia  . Alternatively, fusion genes can lead to enhanced expression of oncogenes via promoter switching, as observed in the case of TMPRSS2-ERG fusions in prostate cancer  . Recent evidence suggests that some fusion genes can bypass microRNA-mediated regulation via 3′untranslated region (3′-UTR) deletion. For example, protein levels of the transcription factor MYB are typically low in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) due to high expression of the MYB repressors miR-15a and miR-16   . However, the 3′-UTR of MYB is lost upon formation of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene, leading to elevated levels of the MYB protein  .","Fusion genes are chromosomal aberrations that are found in many cancers and can be used as prognostic markers and drug targets in clinical practice. Fusions can lead to production of oncogenic fusion proteins or to enhanced expression of oncogenes. Several recent studies have reported that some fusion genes can escape microRNA regulation via 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) deletion. We performed whole transcriptome sequencing to identify fusion genes in glioma and discovered FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in 4 of 48 glioblastoma samples from patients both of mixed European and of Asian descent, but not in any of 43 low-grade glioma samples tested. The fusion, caused by tandem duplication on 4p16.3, led to the loss of the 3'-UTR of FGFR3, blocking gene regulation of miR-99a and enhancing expression of the fusion gene. The fusion gene was mutually exclusive with EGFR, PDGFR, or MET amplification. Using cultured glioblastoma cells and a mouse xenograft model, we found that fusion protein expression promoted cell proliferation and tumor progression, while WT FGFR3 protein was not tumorigenic, even under forced overexpression. These results demonstrated that the FGFR3-TACC3 gene fusion is expressed in human cancer and generates an oncogenic protein that promotes tumorigenesis in glioblastoma.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3561838/pdf/JCI67144.pdf

Histologically, gliomas are graded into individual classes as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system (CNS)","Introduction Despite substantial improvements in standards of care, the most common aggressive pediatric and adult high-grade gliomas (HGG) carry uniformly fatal diagnoses due to unique treatment limitations, high recurrence rates and the absence of effective treatments following recurrence. Recent advancements in our understanding of the pathophysiology, genetics and epigenetics as well as mechanisms of immune surveillance during gliomagenesis have created new knowledge to design more effective and target-directed therapies to improve patient outcomes.Areas covered In this review, the authors discuss the critical genetic, epigenetic and immunologic aberrations found in gliomas that appear rational and promising for therapeutic developments in the presence and future. The current state of the latest therapeutic developments including tumor-specific targeted drug therapies, metabolic targeting, epigenetic modulation and immunotherapy are summarized and suggestions for future directions are offered. Furthermore, they highlight contemporary issues related to the clinical development, such as challenges in clinical trials and toxicities.Expert opinion The commitment to understanding the process of gliomagenesis has created a catalogue of aberrations that depict multiple mechanisms underlying this disease, many of which are suitable to therapeutic inhibition and are currently tested in clinical trials. Thus, future treatment endeavors will employ multiple treatment modalities that target disparate tumor characteristics personalized to the patient's individual tumor.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5674816/pdf/nihms806845.pdf
292,Receptor-Targeted Glial Brain Tumor Therapies,"In the nineteenth century, glial cells were perceived to hold the central nervous system (CNS) together. Hence, the word 'glia' arises from the Greek word, 'glue'  . Glial cells are supportive cells of the central nervous system. Gliomas arise when these supportive glial cells (or neuronal stem cells)     become malignant. The severity of malignancy is categorized in terms of grades. Several pathological features, such as abnormal appearance of the nucleus (nuclear atypia), necrosis, microvascular proliferation, and hemorrhages determine the extent of tumor aggressiveness and prognosis   . Lower grade (I-II) gliomas (LGG) include ependymomas, plilocytic astocytomas, angiocentric gliomas, papillary glioneural tumors, pituicytomas, choroid plexus carcinomas and rosette-forming glioneural tumors of the fourth ventricle. The latter exhibit more benign features and are associated with a better prognosis    .","Among primary brain tumors, malignant gliomas are notably difficult to manage. The higher-grade tumors represent an unmet need in medicine. There have been extensive efforts to implement receptor-targeted therapeutic approaches directed against gliomas. These approaches include immunotherapies, such as vaccines, adoptive immunotherapy, and passive immunotherapy. Targeted cytotoxic radio energy and pro-drug activation have been designed specifically for brain tumors. The field of targeting through receptors progressed significantly with the discovery of an interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13RA2) as a tumor-associated receptor over-expressed in most patients with glioblastoma (GBM) but not in normal brain. IL-13RA2 has been exploited in novel experimental therapies with very encouraging clinical responses. Other receptors are specifically over-expressed in many patients with GBM, such as EphA2 and EphA3 receptors, among others. These findings are important in view of the heterogeneity of GBM tumors and multiple tumor compartments responsible for tumor progression and resistance to therapies. The combined targeting of multiple receptors in different tumor compartments should be a preferred way to design novel receptor-targeted therapeutic approaches in gliomas.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/ijms/ijms-19-03326/article_deploy/ijms-19-03326.pdf
372,"XL-184, a MET, VEGFR-2 and RET kinase inhibitor for the treatment of thyroid cancer, glioblastoma multiforme and NSCLC","Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a large family of cell surface receptors that are endowed with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity. These kinases are activated by various ligands and play an important role in the control of most fundamental cellular processes, including activity in the cell cycle, cell migration, cell metabolism and cell survival, as well as cell proliferation and differentiation. The effects of RTKs are mediated by a complex network of cell signaling cascades, the most well known of which are the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways  . Aberrant activation of RTKs can occur via ligand and/or receptor transcriptional overexpression, gene amplification, activating mutations or epigenetic mechanisms, and leads to enhanced malignancy in a wide variety of cancers, including medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and NSCLC  ,  ,  .","XL-184 (BMS-907351), under development by Exelixis Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, is a pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the potential oral treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, glioblastoma multiforme and NSCLC. The prinicipal targets of XL-184 are MET, VEGFR-2 and RET, but the drug is also reported to display inhibitory activity against KIT, FLT3 and TEK. Preclinical studies demonstrated that XL-184 potently inhibited multiple receptor tyrosine kinases in various cancer cell lines and animal xenograft models, and that the drug exhibited significant oral bioavailability and blood-brain barrier penetration.

410,Calcium-activated potassium channels mediated blood-brain tumor barrier opening in a rat metastatic brain tumor model,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB), formed by the capillary endothelial cells surrounded by astrocytes, protects the brain, but it also poses an obstacle for the delivery of therapeutic molecules into the brain. Microvessels supplying brain tumors retain some characteristics of the BBB and form a blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB). While adequate delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs has been achieved in systemic tumors, the BTB limits such delivery to brain metastases. Therefore, understanding the biochemical modulation of BBB and BTB is critical for developing strategies to deliver therapeutic agents into metastatic brain tumors."," The blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB) impedes the delivery of therapeutic agents to brain tumors. While adequate delivery of drugs occurs in systemic tumors, the BTB limits delivery of anti-tumor agents into brain metastases. In this study, we examined the function and regulation of calcium-activated potassium (K-Ca) channels in a rat metastatic brain tumor model. We showed that intravenous infusion of NS1619, a K-Ca channel agonist, and bradykinin selectively enhanced BTB permeability in brain tumors, but not in normal brain. Iberiotoxin, a KCa channel antagonist, significantly attenuated NS1619-induced BTB permeability increase. We found KCa channels and bradykinin type 2 receptors (B2R) expressed in cultured human metastatic brain tumor cells (CRL-5904, non-small cell lung cancer, metastasized to brain), human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human lung cancer brain metastasis tissues. Potentiometric assays demonstrated the activity of KCa channels in metastatic brain tumor cells and HBMEC. Furthermore, we detected higher expression of KCa channels in the metastatic brain tumor tissue and tumor capillary endothelia as compared to normal brain tissue. Co-culture of metastatic brain tumor cells and brain microvessel endothelial cells showed an upregulation of KCa channels, which may contribute to the overexpression of KCa channels in tumor microvessels and selectivity of BTB opening. These findings suggest that KCa channels in metastatic brain tumors may serve as an effective target for biochemical modulation of BTB permeability to enhance selective delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to metastatic brain tumors.",https//molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1476-4598-6-22.pdf
433,Efficacy and safety results of ABT-414 in combination with radiation and temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma remains an incurable disease with an urgent need for better treatment options. Standard treatment consists of surgical resection followed by radiation plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide therapy. EGFR is a known driver of glioblastoma growth; however, several trials of EGFR inhibitors have failed to produce meaningful or durable efficacy. ABT-414, an antibody-drug conjugate, utilizes a novel approach to target the aberrant EGFR (amplified, overexpressed, or mutated) expressed on tumor cells. Upon binding to EGFR, ABT-414 delivers the cytotoxin directly into these cells. Conventional EGFR inhibitor toxicity is absent because ABT-414 does not bind to wild-type EGFR present on normal cells, and the parent antibody (ABT-806) has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to EGFR-expressing intracranial tumors. In the present study, we report the safety, pharmacokinetics, and promising antitumor activity of ABT-414 in combination with radiation and temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.",". The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RPTD), safety, and pharmacokinetics of ABT-414 plus radiation and temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. ABT-414 is a first-in-class, tumor-specific antibody-drug conjugate that preferentially targets tumors expressing overactive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).s. In this multicenter phase I study, patients received 0.5-3.2 mg/kg ABT-414 every 2 weeks by intravenous infusion. EGFR alterations, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter hypermethylation, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) gene mutations were assessed in patient tumors. Distinct prognostic classes were assigned to patients based on a Molecular Classification Predictor model.. As of January 7, 2016, forty-five patients were enrolled to receive ABT-414 plus radiation and temozolomide. The most common treatment emergent adverse events were ocular blurred vision, dry eye, keratitis, photophobia, and eye pain. Ocular toxicity at any grade occurred in 40 patients and at grades 3/4 in 12 patients. RPTD and MTD were set at 2 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg, respectively. Among 38 patients with pretreatment tumor tested centrally, 39% harbored EGFR amplification, of which 73% had EGFRvIII mutation. Among patients with available tumor tissue (n = 30), 30% showed MGMT promoter methylation and none had IDH1 mutations. ABT-414 demonstrated an approximately dose proportional pharmacokinetic profile. The median duration of progression-free survival was 6.1 months; median overall survival has not been reached.. ABT-414 plus chemoradiation demonstrated an acceptable safety and pharmacokinetic profile in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Randomized studies are ongoing to determine efficacy in newly diagnosed (NCT02573324) and recurrent glioblastoma (NCT02343406).",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5570193/pdf/now257.pdf
466,In situ characterization of stem cells-like biomarkers in meningiomas,"Meningiomas occur in multiple extra-axial locations within arachnoid membranes and are highly frequent compared with other types of central nervous system tumors (CNSTs)    .

Unfortunately, up to 20% of grade I tumors reoccur, and apart from Mib-1, molecular markers that enable prediction of recurrence have not been established    ."," Meningioma cancer stem cells (MCSCs) contribute to tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance. Successful therapies developed for inoperable, recurrent, or metastatic tumors must target these cells and restrict their contribution to tumor progression. Unfortunately, the identity of MCSCs remains elusive, and MSCSs' in situ spatial distribution, heterogeneity, and relationship with tumor grade, remain unclear.s Seven tumors classified as grade II or grade III, including one case of metastatic grade III, and eight grade I meningioma tumors, were analyzed for combinations of ten stem cell (SC)-related markers using immunofluorescence of consecutive sections. The correlation of expression for all markers were investigated. Three dimensional spatial distribution of markers were qualitatively analyzed using a grid, designed as a repository of information for positive staining. All statistical analyses were completed using Statistical Analysis Software Package. The patterns of expression for SC-related markers were determined in the context of two dimensional distribution and cellular features. All markers could be detected in all tumors, however, Frizzled 9 and GFAP had differential expression in grade II/III compared with grade I meningioma tissues. Correlation analysis showed significant relationships between the expression of GFAP and CD133 as well as SSEA4 and Vimentin. Data from three dimensional analysis showed a complex distribution of SC markers, with increased gene hetero-expression being associated with grade II/III tumors. Sub regions that showed multiple co-staining of markers including CD133, Frizzled 9, GFAP, Vimentin, and SSEA4, but not necessarily the proliferation marker Ki67, were highly associated with grade II/III meningiomas. The distribution and level of expression of CSCs markers in meningiomas are variable and show heteroexpression patterns that have a complex spatial nature, particularly in grade II/III meningiomas. Thus, results strongly support the notion of heterogeneous populations of CSCs, even in grade I meningiomas, and call for the use of multiple markers for the accurate identification of individual CSC subgroups. Such identification will lead to practical clinical diagnostic protocols that can quantitate CSCs, predict tumor recurrence, assist in guiding treatment selection for inoperable tumors, and improve follow up of therapy.",https//cancerci.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12935-018-0571-6.pdf
488,Aptamers and Glioblastoma Their Potential Use for Imaging and Therapeutic Applications,"Glioblastoma or grade IV glioma is a highly malignant primary brain tumour with a particularly poor median survival duration of 14 months  . Whilst the incidence rate of glioblastoma currently stands markedly low at 3.2 per 100,000 population, its five-year survival rate is below 6%  . These tumours can arise spontaneously from glial cells, or can develop from the progression of a lower grade glioma and are defined as primary or secondary glioblastomas, respectively (see Figure 1 )  . Histological features of glioblastoma include increased cellularity and angiogenesis, vascular proliferation, hemorrhage, necrosis, and cystic regions throughout the tumours   . Cell populations within these tumours tend to vary greatly, with the presence of both small, undifferentiated cells and large cells with multiple nuclei reported  .","Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary brain tumour, renowned for its infiltrative growth and varied genetic profiles. The current treatment options are insufficient, and their off-target effects greatly reduce patient quality of life. The major challenge in improving glioblastoma diagnosis and treatment involves the development of a targeted imaging and drug delivery platform, capable of circumventing the blood brain barrier and specifically targeting glioblastoma tumours. The unique properties of aptamers demonstrate their capability of bridging the gap to the development of successful diagnosis and treatment options, where antibodies have previously failed. Aptamers possess many characteristics that make them an ideal novel imaging and therapeutic agent for the treatment of glioblastoma and other brain malignancies, and are likely to provide patients with a better standard of care and improved quality of life. Their target sensitivity, selective nature, ease of modification and low immunogenicity make them an ideal drug-delivery platform. This review article summarises the aptamers previously generated against glioblastoma cells or its identified biomarkers, and their potential application in diagnosis and therapeutic targeting of glioblastoma tumours.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/ijms/ijms-18-02576/article_deploy/ijms-18-02576.pdf
525,New treatment options in the management of glioblastoma multiforme a focus on bevacizumab,"Cancers of the brain and nervous system are relatively rare. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) continues to be the most common and lethal malignant primary brain tumor in adults.  The exact pathogenesis thus far has remained elusive, and most occur in a sporadic fashion.       Rarely they occur in the setting of hereditary syndromes.  Despite an aggressive multimodal approach, the median survival time after diagnosis is approximately a year with population-based studies demonstrating even lower median survival rates.  0 Surgery allows histological diagnosis and can provide relief for neurological deficits related to mass effect. Surgery, however, is not curative due to the infiltrative nature of the disease. While only retrospective data are available to evaluate survival benefit, extent of resection correlates with better prognosis. []   Radiation therapy has been the mainstay treatment for GBM for decades extending median survival to about 9 months versus a median survival of 3 months with no therapy.     [] The role of chemotherapy in gliomas has historically been disappointing, with adjuvant therapy extending longer-term survival in the minority of GBM patients. 6, 7, 9 This is in contrast to the more chemosensitive oligodendrogliomas harboring p/9q deletions.  Chemotherapy as standard of care for GBM was only recently established in 05, when Stupp et al demonstrated that daily temozolomide (TMZ) combined with radiation followed by 6 months of adjuvant monthly cycle TMZ increased median survival by 3 months when compared to radiotherapy alone, and increased 2-year survival from 0% to 26%. 2 Once disease progression occurs, available salvage chemotherapies are usually unsuccessful, demonstrating a 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) of only 5%.

","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and carries the poorest prognosis. Despite recent progress in molecular biology, neuro-imaging and neuro-surgical care, the management of patients with GBM continues to harbor significant challenges. Survival after diagnosis is poor even with the most aggressive approach using multimodality therapy. Although the etiology of malignant gliomas is not known, the dependency of tumor growth on angiogenesis has identified this pathway as a promising therapeutic target. Bevacizumab was the first antiangiogenic therapy approved for use in cancer and received accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of recurrent GBM in 2009, the first new drug for this disease in over a decade.

561,A novel implantable catheter system with transcutaneous port for intermittent convection-enhanced delivery of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastoma,"Despite advances in surgical methods and adjuvant therapies, the prognosis for patients with glioblastoma remains poor. Median survival with maximal treatment is reported as 14.6 months  .","Context Inadequate penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by systemically administered chemotherapies including carboplatin is implicated in their failure to improve prognosis for patients with glioblastoma. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of carboplatin has the potential to improve outcomes by facilitating bypass of the BBB. We report the first use of an implantable CED system incorporating a novel transcutaneous bone-anchored port (TBAP) for intermittent CED of carboplatin in a patient with recurrent glioblastoma.Materials and methods The CED catheter system was implanted using a robot-assisted surgical method. Catheter targeting accuracy was verified by performing intra-operative O-arm imaging. The TBAP was implanted using a skin-flap dermatome technique modeled on bone-anchored hearing aid surgery. Repeated infusions were performed by attaching a needle administration set to the TBAP. Drug distribution was monitored with serial real-time T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All catheters were implanted to within 1.5mm of their planned target. Intermittent infusions of carboplatin were performed on three consecutive days and repeated after one month without the need for further surgical intervention. Infused volumes of 27.9ml per day were well tolerated, with the exception of a single seizure episode. Follow-up MRI at eight weeks demonstrated a significant reduction in the volume of tumor enhancement from 42.6ml to 24.6ml, and was associated with stability of the patient's clinical condition. Reduction in the volume of tumor enhancement indicates that intermittent CED of carboplatin has the potential to improve outcomes in glioblastoma. The novel technology described in this report make intermittent CED infusion regimes an achievable treatment strategy.",https//www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10717544.2014.908248?needAccess=true
587,The efficacy of a coordinated pharmacological blockade in glioblastoma stem cells with nine repurposed drugs using the CUSP9 strategy,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor that, despite multimodal oncological therapy, relapses within 6-9 months  . A major challenge in developing new treatments is the intricate tumor heterogeneity at the molecular and cellular level    . Targeted therapies have been sought to address the molecular heterogeneity in GBM, but dozens of clinical trials have failed to demonstrate survival benefit  .","Constructed from a theoretical framework, the coordinated undermining of survival paths in glioblastoma (GBM) is a combination of nine drugs approved for non-oncological indications (CUSP9; aprepitant, auranofin, captopril, celecoxib, disulfiram, itraconazole, minocycline, quetiapine, and sertraline) combined with temozolomide (TMZ). The availability of these drugs outside of specialized treatment centers has led patients to embark on combination treatments without systematic follow-up. However, no experimental data on efficacy using the CUSP9 strategy in GBM have been reported.sUsing patient-derived glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) cultures from 15 GBM patients, we described stem cell properties of individual cultures, determined the dose-response relationships of the drugs in the CUSP9, and assessed the efficacy the CUSP9 combination with TMZ in concentrations clinically achievable. The efficacy was evaluated by cell viability, cytotoxicity, and sphere-forming assays in both primary and recurrent GSC cultures.We found that CUSP9 with TMZ induced a combination effect compared to the drugs individually (p<0.0001). Evaluated by cell viability and cytotoxicity, 50% of the GSC cultures displayed a high sensitivity to the drug combination. In clinical plasma concentrations, the effect of the CUSP9 with TMZ was superior to TMZ monotherapy (p<0.001). The Wnt-signaling pathway has been shown important in GSC, and CUSP9 significantly reduces Wnt-activity.Adding experimental data to the theoretical rationale of CUSP9, our results demonstrate that the CUSP9 treatment strategy can induce a combination effect in both treatment-naive and pretreated GSC cultures; however, predicting response in individual cultures will require further profiling of GSCs.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6527541/pdf/432_2019_Article_2920.pdf
616,Endoglin and TGF-beta signaling in glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is the most prevalent and malignant primary brain tumor and remains essentially fatal despite current multi-modality therapy  . Glioblastoma is a highly vascularized tumor. There is the notion that a proportion of glioblastoma vasculature is neoplastic as glioblastoma stem cells may differentiate into CD31-positive endothelial cells or smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive pericytes  ). Yet, treatment with the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab targeting the pivotal proangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has not improved overall survival of glioblastoma patients in recurrent  or newly diagnosed glioblastoma   or on a population level  . This indicates that multiple factors may participate in glioma neoangiogenesis or that its inhibition may not affect overall outcome.","Microvascular proliferation is a key feature of glioblastoma and neovascularization has been implicated in tumor progression. Glioblastomas use pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for new blood vessel formation. Yet, anti-VEGF therapy does not prolong overall survival so that alternative angiogenic pathways may need to be explored as drug targets. Both glioma cells and glioma-associated endothelial cells produce TGF-beta superfamily ligands which bind TGF-beta receptors (TGF-beta R). The TGF-beta R type III endoglin (CD105), is a marker of proliferating endothelium that has already been studied as a potential therapeutic target. We studied endoglin expression in glioblastoma tissue and in glioma-associated endothelial cells in a cohort of 52 newly diagnosed and 10 recurrent glioblastoma patients by immunohistochemistry and by ex vivo single-cell gene expression profiling of 6 tumors. Endoglin protein levels were similar in tumor stroma and endothelium and correlated within tumors. Similarly, endoglin mRNA determined by ex vivo single-cell gene expression profiling was expressed in both compartments. There was positive correlation between endoglin and proteins of TGF-beta superfamily signaling. No prognostic role of endoglin expression in either compartment was identified. Endoglin gene silencing in T98G glioma cells and in human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC) did not affect constitutive or exogenous TGF-beta superfamily ligand-dependent signaling, except for a minor facilitation of pSmad1/5 signaling in hCMEC. These observations challenge the notion that endoglin might become a promising therapeutic target in glioblastoma.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00441-020-03323-5.pdf
637,In Vitro and In Vivo Analysis of RTK Inhibitor Efficacy and Identification of Its Novel Targets in Glioblastomas,"Brain tumors represent the leading cause of cancer-related death in children and the fourth in middle-aged men  . Gliomas are the most frequent, accounting for approximately 70% of all primary brain tumors. According to the World Health Organization, gliomas can be divided in four grades of malignancy and three histologic subtypes, being astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma) the most common subtype   . Glioblastomas are among the most lethal tumors, with median survival of approximately 16 months, despite aggressive surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy  . So far, temozolomide, a cytotoxic drug, remains the only anticancer agent that has improved outcome, but almost all glioblastoma patients eventually develop tumor recurrence, resulting in death  . Therefore, it is imperative to improve the treatment options for glioblastoma.","Treatment for glioblastoma consists of radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemotherapy. However, virtually all patients recur, leading to a fatal outcome. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-targeted therapy has been the focus of attention in novel treatment options for these patients. Here, we compared the efficacy of imatinib, sunitinib, and cediranib in glioblastoma models. In the present work, the biologic effect of the drugs was screened by viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in vitro assays or in vivo by chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Intracellular signaling was assessed by Western blot and the RTK targets were identified using phospho-RTK arrays. The amplified status of KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGFR2 genes was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In a panel of 10 glioblastoma cell lines, we showed that cediranib was the most potent. In addition, cediranib and sunitinib synergistically sensitize the cells to temozolomide. Cediranib efficacy was shown to associate with higher cytostatic and unique cytotoxic effects in vitro and both antitumoral and antiangiogenic activity in vivo, which could associate with its great capacity to inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways. The molecular status of KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGFR2 did not predict glioblastoma cell responsiveness to any of the RTK inhibitors. Importantly, phospho-RTK arrays revealed novel targets for cediranib and sunitinib therapy. In conclusion, the novel targets found may be of value as future biomarkers for therapy response in glioblastoma and lead to the rational selection of patients for effective molecular targeted treatment.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3610556/pdf/tlo0602_0187.pdf
676,"Super selective intra-arterial cerebral infusion of modern chemotherapeutics after blood-brain barrier disruption where are we now, and where we are going","Intra-arterial (IA) delivery of therapeutic agents to the central nervous system (CNS) is an appealing strategy for the treatment of brain tumors. Intra-arterial drug delivery enables delivery of treatment through a tumor's extensive capillary network and the peritumoral vasculature while limiting the volume of distribution to a targeted vascular region, and simultaneously potentially reducing systemic toxicity.","Introduction Intra-arterial (IA) delivery of therapeutic agents across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an evolving strategy which enables the distribution of high concentration therapeutics through a targeted vascular territory, while potentially limiting systemic toxicity. Studies have demonstrated IA methods to be safe and efficacious for a variety of therapeutics. However, further characterization of the clinical efficacy of IA therapy for the treatment of brain tumors and refinement of its potential applications are necessary. s We have reviewed the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting superselective intraarterial cerebral infusion (SSIACI) with BBB disruption for the treatment of brain tumors. In addition, we review ongoing clinical trials expanding the applicability and investigating the efficacy of IA therapy for the treatment of brain tumors.  Trends in recent studies have embraced the use of SSIACI and less neurotoxic chemotherapies. The majority of trials continue to use mannitol as the preferred method of hyperosmolar BBB disruption. Recent preclinical and preliminary human investigations into the IA delivery of Bevacizumab have demonstrated its safety and efficacy as an anti-tumor agent both alone and in combination with chemotherapy.  IA drug delivery may significantly affect the way treatments are delivered to patients with brain tumors, and in particular GBM. With refinement and standardization of the techniques of IA drug delivery, improved drug selection and formulations, and the development of methods to minimize treatment-related neurological injury, IA therapy may offer significant benefits for the treatment of brain tumors.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-020-03435-6.pdf
727,Radiosensitization of gliomas by intracellular generation of 5-fluorouracil potentiates prodrug activator gene therapy with a retroviral replicating vector,"Conventional replication-defective vectors, which are incapable of further propagation beyond initial infection, do not diffuse far from the injection site and therefore are inadequate for gene delivery into large solid tumors  . Thus, the major obstacle has been the low efficiency of delivering prodrug activator genes to sufficient numbers of cancer cells in vivo using non-replicating vectors. To address such issues, we have developed retroviral replicating vectors (RRV), which we and others have shown in a variety of preclinical models to be capable of highly efficient gene delivery throughout solid tumor masses concomitant with viral replication         [0] . RRV-mediated gene delivery is tumor-selective in vivo because of the inability of RRV to infect non-dividing cells, and because anti-viral defense mechanisms active in normal cells are frequently mutated in cancer cells. We and others have confirmed that RRV are highly effective vectors for prodrug activator therapy in experimental models of glioma    [0] []   , and unlike oncolytic replicating viruses currently being tested in the clinic, RRV replication is intrinsically non-lytic and so the immunosuppressive tumor environment continues to shield the virus until extensive spread is attained, after which infected cells can be killed selectively and synchronously upon prodrug administration. Moreover, as the retrovirus integrates its transgene permanently into the cancer cell genome, residual infected glioma cells can become a reservoir for re-infection of malignant cells upon recurrence, enabling repeated cycles of prodrug administration to achieve further therapeutic benefit even after only a single injection of RRV  2 .","A tumor-selective non-lytic retroviral replicating vector (RRV), Toca 511, and an extended-release formulation of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), Toca FC, are currently being evaluated in clinical trials in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (NCT01156584, NCT01470794 and NCT01985256). Tumor-selective propagation of this RRV enables highly efficient transduction of glionna cells with cytosine deaminase (CD), which serves as a prodrug activator for conversion of the anti-fungal prodrug 5-FC to the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) directly within the infected cells. We investigated whether, in addition to its direct cytotoxic effects, 5-FU generated intracellularly by RRV-mediated CD/5-FC prodrug activator gene therapy could also act as a radiosensitizing agent. Efficient transduction by RRV and expression of CD were confirmed in the highly aggressive, radioresistant human glioblastoma cell line U87EGFRvIII and its parental cell line U87MG (U87). RRV-transduced cells showed significant radiosensitization even after transient exposure to 5-FC. This was confirmed both in vitro by a clonogenic colony survival assay and in vivo by bioluminescence imaging analysis. These results provide a convincing rationale for development of tumor-targeted radiosensitization strategies utilizing the tumor-selective replicative capability of RRV, and incorporation of radiation therapy into future clinical trials evaluating Toca 511 and Toca FC in brain tumor patients.",https//escholarship.org/content/qt3j39z822/qt3j39z822.pdf?t=qaei7e
751,Targeting EGFR for Treatment of Glioblastoma Molecular Basis to Overcome Resistance,"Malignant gliomas, the most common primary intracranial brain tumors in adults, are among the deadliest of human cancers because they are highly invasive and neurologically destructive  . The median survival of patients with the most aggressive of these, WHO grade IV glioblastoma (GBM), is 12-15 months with a 5-year survival rate that remains at less than 5%, despite the use of intensive treatment modalities (i.e. surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy)  . Thus, the development of novel efficacious therapies is greatly warranted to substantially improve the poor prognosis of patients afflicted with GBM.","Glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme; GBM; WHO Grade IV) accounts for the majority of primary malignant brain tumors in adults. Amplification and mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene represent signature genetic abnormalities encountered in GBM.

Data from experimental studies evaluating these therapies have been very promising; however, their efficacy in the clinic has so far been limited by both upfront and acquired drug resistance. This review discusses the current status of anti-EGFR agents and the recurrent problem of resistance to these agents that strongly indicates that a multiple target approach will provide a more favorable future for these types of targeted therapies in GBM.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3464093/pdf/nihms-406945.pdf
780,Intratumoral Heterogeneity and Longitudinal Changes in Gene Expression Predict Differential Drug Sensitivity in Newly Diagnosed and Recurrent Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GB), with a median survival rate of around 15 months, ranks amongst the most aggressive of human cancers  . The current standard of care for GB consists of de-bulking surgery followed by combined treatments with fractionated ionizing radiation (IR) and the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ)  . Unfortunately, the overall effectiveness of standard therapy is limited because of the high degree of intrinsic radioresistance and restricted effectiveness of TMZ working in only about a half of GBs  . Tumor recurrence after initial treatment is inevitable and poses a major challenge in clinical management of GB. At the stage of recurrence, no effective therapeutic options are currently available, rendering recurrent GB (recGB) a lethal condition. Despite intensive efforts to optimize dosage/combination regimens of cytotoxic monotherapies for recGB, no level one evidence has been achieved so far    . Molecular diagnostic criteria specific for recGB do not exist either. Clinical recommendations for recGB are based on the status of the very same predictive markers as those assessed in the precursor tumor at the time of initial diagnosis. Recent advances indicate that such an assumption may be misleading because it does not take into consideration the longitudinal changes in molecular patterns during GB growth after (or under) cytotoxic treatments. Although the mechanisms of molecular diversification during GB recurrence are still incompletely understood, the existing evidence suggests that alkylating treatments including TMZ may promote proactively the emergence of a hypermutator phenotype   . Recent advances indicate that so-called therapy-driven molecular evolution is a fundamental trait associated with GB recurrence. Furthermore, there is an emerging consensus that traditional diagnostic approaches based on analyses of a single tumor biopsy may be insufficient for implementing molecular diagnostics of GBs that are notorious for the high degree of intratumoral spatial heterogeneity      . Reflecting the importance of sampling strategy and treatment-driven molecular evolution in (re)shaping molecular landscapes during GB recurrence, a so-called GLASS (The Glioma Longitudinal AnalySiS, https//www.glass-consortium.org/) consortium has recently been formed to address these issues in the frame of a multicenter investigation  ."," Inevitable recurrence after radiochemotherapy is the major problem in the treatment of glioblastoma, the most prevalent type of adult brain malignancy. Glioblastomas are notorious for a high degree of intratumor heterogeneity manifest through a diversity of cell types and molecular patterns. The current paradigm of understanding glioblastoma recurrence is that cytotoxic therapy fails to target effectively glioma stem cells. Recent advances indicate that therapy-driven molecular evolution is a fundamental trait associated with glioblastoma recurrence. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that intratumor heterogeneity, longitudinal changes in molecular biomarkers and specific impacts of glioma stem cells need to be taken into consideration in order to increase the accuracy of molecular diagnostics still relying on readouts obtained from a single tumor specimen. s This study integrates a multisampling strategy, longitudinal approach and complementary transcriptomic investigations in order to identify transcriptomic traits of recurrent glioblastoma in whole-tissue specimens of glioblastoma or glioblastoma stem cells. In this study, 128 tissue samples of 44 tumors including 23 first diagnosed, 19 recurrent and 2 secondary recurrent glioblastomas were analyzed along with 27 primary cultures of glioblastoma stem cells by RNA sequencing. A novel algorithm was used to quantify longitudinal changes in pathway activities and model efficacy of anti-cancer drugs based on gene expression data.  Our study reveals that intratumor heterogeneity of gene expression patterns is a fundamental characteristic of not only newly diagnosed but also recurrent glioblastomas. Evidence is provided that glioblastoma stem cells recapitulate intratumor heterogeneity, longitudinal transcriptomic changes and drug sensitivity patterns associated with the state of recurrence.  Our results provide a transcriptional rationale for the lack of significant therapeutic benefit from temozolomide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Our findings imply that the spectrum of potentially effective drugs is likely to differ between newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastomas and underscore the merits of glioblastoma stem cells as prognostic models for identifying alternative drugs and predicting drug response in recurrent glioblastoma. With the majority of recurrent glioblastomas being inoperable, glioblastoma stem cell models provide the means of compensating for the limited availability of recurrent glioblastoma specimens.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/cancers/cancers-12-00520/article_deploy/cancers-12-00520-v2.pdf
810,Drug Repositioning in Glioblastoma A Pathway Perspective,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive adult primary brain tumor. Despite decades of research and clinical trials, the median survival remains at approximately 14 months. This is in part due to the highly invasive nature of GBM cells, which makes complete surgical resection difficult. In addition, GBM cells develop resistance against the current multimodal treatment regimen that includes the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation. Furthermore, tumors expressing the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) are resistant to TMZ. Finally, many targeted therapies fail in clinical trials because they do not effectively cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Collectively, these findings necessitate the discovery of novel therapeutic avenues for treating GBM. Impressive technological advances have enabled us to decipher the genetic and cellular makeup of GBM tumors   . However, the lengthy time required to develop new small molecules and to demonstrate their efficacy and safety in preclinical models is a major impediment for uncovering novel treatments for this devastating disorder.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant primary adult brain tumor. The current standard of care is surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy treatment, which extends life in most cases. Unfortunately, tumor recurrence is nearly universal and patients with recurrent glioblastoma typically survive <1 year. Therefore, new therapies and therapeutic combinations need to be developed that can be quickly approved for use in patients. However, in order to gain approval, therapies need to be safe as well as effective. One possible means of attaining rapid approval is repurposing FDA approved compounds for GBM therapy. However, candidate compounds must be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and therefore a selection process has to be implemented to identify such compounds that can eliminate GBM tumor expansion. We review here psychiatric and non-psychiatric compounds that may be effective in GBM, as well as potential drugs targeting cell death pathways. We also discuss the potential of data-driven computational approaches to identify compounds that induce cell death in GBM cells, enabled by large reference databases such as the Library of Integrated Network Cell Signatures (LINCS). Finally, we argue that identifying pathways dysregulated in GBM in a patient specific manner is essential for effective repurposing in GBM and other gliomas.",https//fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/349912/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fphar-09-00218/fphar-09-00218.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=7HyuvbIouDAflP0uAfWXCv6CxUQiMXFYFBJzxRIHXbk%3D&se=2021-03-02T02%3A35%3A11Z&sp=r&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27fphar-09-00218.pdf
889,Convection-enhanced Delivery of Therapeutics for Malignant Gliomas,"the success of molecular-targeted therapies for several cancers, including non small-cell lung cancer, 1) melanoma,  and chronic myelogenous leukemia,  has opened a new era in cancer treatment. this therapeutic strategy holds significant promise for the treatment of malignant gliomas. numerous molecular-targeted agents have been tested over the past decade, mostly with unsuccessful results. only one agent, bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEgF), has been granted approval (2009) by the US Food and Drug administration (FDa) for treating recurrent glioblastoma.    other agents, although successful against other cancers, have failed to demonstrate efficacy against malignant gliomas. Drug delivery has been proposed as a possible explanation for this failure. although the blood-brain barrier (BBB) at the core of brain tumors may be disrupted, heterogeneous incomplete disruption still prevents effective drug delivery. Local drug delivery can overcome this obstacle; however, effective local drug delivery remains a challenge.","Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) circumvents the blood-brain barrier by delivering agents directly into the tumor and surrounding parenchyma. CED can achieve large volumes of distribution by continuous positive-pressure infusion. Although promising as an effective drug delivery method in concept, the administration of therapeutic agents via CED is not without challenges. Limitations of distribution remain a problem in large brains, such as those of humans. Accurate and consistent delivery of an agent is another challenge associated with CED. Similar to the difficulties caused by immunosuppressive environments associated with gliomas, there are several mechanisms that make effective local drug distribution difficult in malignant gliomas. In this review, methods for local drug application targeting gliomas are discussed with special emphasis on CED. Although early clinical trials have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of CED against gliomas, CED potentially can be a platform for translating the molecular understanding of glioblastomas achieved in the laboratory into effective clinical treatments. Several clinical studies using CED of chemotherapeutic agents are ongoing. Successful delivery of effective agents should prove the efficacy of CED in the near future.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5243160/pdf/nmc-57-008.pdf
902,Temozolomide suppresses MYC via activation of TAp63 to inhibit progression of human glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive and chemoradioresistant brain malignancy. Temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA-alkylating agent, is effective against GBM and has become the standard first-line drug. However, the mechanism by which TMZ regulates the progression of GBM remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that TMZ targets TAp63, a p53 family member, inducing its expression to suppress the progression of human GBM. High levels of TAp63 expression in GBM tissues after TMZ treatment was an indicator of favourable prognosis. In human GBM cells, TMZ-induced TAp63 directly repressed MYC transcription. Activation of this TAp63-MYC pathway by TMZ inhibited human GBM progression both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, downregulation of MYC mRNA levels in recurrent GBMs after TMZ treatment correlated with better patient survival. Therefore, our results suggest that the TAp63-mediated transcriptional repression of MYC is a novel pathway regulating TMZ efficacy in GBM.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive and chemoradioresistant brain malignancy.

Furthermore, downregulation of MYC mRNA levels in recurrent GBMs after TMZ treatment correlated with better patient survival. Therefore, our results suggest that the TAp63-mediated transcriptional repression of MYC is a novel pathway regulating TMZ efficacy in GBM.",https//www.nature.com/articles/srep01160.pdf
929,Overview of Current Drug Delivery s Across the Blood-Brain Barrier for the Treatment of Primary Brain Tumors,"Most primary brain tumors, such as high-grade glioma, have an exceedingly poor prognosis due to their tumor location and fast development in both adult and pediatric patients     . The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important obstacle for drug delivery in most brain cancers      . The BBB is a complex interplay between endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, basal lamina, and extracellular matrix (ECM). These components, together with smooth muscle cells and neurons, form the neurovascular unit (NVU), which in turn regulates cerebral blood flow and BBB function    . The consequence of this tightly regulated barrier is that toxins and drugs, including chemotherapy, do not readily cross the BBB, posing a problem for drug delivery into the brain.","Existing drug delivery methods have not led to a significant increase in survival for patients with malignant primary brain tumors. While the combination of conventional therapies consisting of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy has improved survival for some types of brain tumors (e.g., WNT medulloblastoma), other types of brain tumors (e.g., glioblastoma and diffuse midline glioma) still have a poor prognosis. The reason for the differences in response can be largely attributed to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a specialized structure at the microvasculature level that regulates the transport of molecules across the blood vessels into the brain parenchyma. This structure hampers the delivery of most chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of primary brain tumors. Several drug delivery methods such as nanoparticles, convection enhanced delivery, focused ultrasound, intranasal delivery, and intra-arterial delivery have been developed to overcome the BBB in primary brain tumors. However, prognosis of most primary brain tumors still remains poor. The heterogeneity of the BBB in primary brain tumors and the distinct vasculature of tumors make it difficult to design a drug delivery method that targets the entire tumor. Drug delivery methods that combine strategies such as focused ultrasound and nanoparticles might be a more successful approach. However, more research is needed to optimize and develop new drug delivery techniques to improve survival of patients with primary brain tumors.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7658069/pdf/40263_2020_Article_766.pdf
963,CD133 and DNA-PK regulate MDR1 via the PI3K-or Akt-NF-kappa B pathway in multidrug-resistant glioblastoma cells in vitro,"Glioblastoma is the most common and highly malignant form of brain tumor. Despite advances in surgery and radiotherapy, the prognosis for malignant gliomas remains poor with a median survival time under 1.5 years. Numerous chemotherapeutic agents have been used to treat glioblastomas. Irrespective of the agent, acquisition of multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major challenge. Mechanisms of MDR acquisition differ in response to different reagents. For instance, O  -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase methylation is a principal factor contributing to sensitivity in response to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents such as temozolomide.   However, overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as MDR protein 1 (MDR1, also known as P-glycoprotein), and MDR-associated proteins, are primary mechanisms for MDR.  MDR-associated proteins have been associated with human glioma cell lines, 5 however, MDRassociated protein levels are low in human high-grade glioma tumor specimens. ,  MDR1, encoded by the ABCB1 gene, is enhanced in response to chemotherapeutic agents in clinical tumors and in cancer cell cultures,  including cultured glioma cells and human primary high-grade gliomas. ,  Over the past decades, therapeutic strategies have targeted MDR1.   Despite promising in vitro results, outcomes in clinical trials have been disappointing.  Thus, the mechanisms, which bring about drug resistance in glioblastoma cells, need to be further elucidated to develop novel therapies adjuvant to directly targeting MDR1.","Chemotherapy is an adjuvant treatment for glioblastomas, however, chemotherapy remains palliative because of the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). Following prolonged chemotherapy, MDR protein 1 (MDR1) and CD133 increase in recurrent glioblastomas. CD133 positive (CD133+) glioma cancer stem-like cells (GCSCs) markedly promote drug resistance and exhibit increased DNA damage repair capability; thus they have a key role in determining tumor chemosensitivity. Although CD133, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and MDR1 are elevated in CD133+ GCSCs, the relationship among these molecules has not been elucidated. In this study, MDR glioblastoma cell lines were created in response to prolonged doxorubicin chemotherapy. CD133, DNA-PK and MDR1 were markedly elevated in these cells. CD133 and DNA-PK may increase MDR1 via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signal pathway. PI3K downstream targets Akt and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, which interacts with the MDR1 promoter, were also elevated in these cells. Downregulation of CD133 and DNA-PK by small interfering RNA, or inhibition of PI3K or Akt, decreased Akt, NF-kappa B and MDR1 expression. The results indicate that CD133 and DNA-PK regulate MDR1 through the PI3K- or Akt-NF-kappa B signal pathway. Consequently, a novel chemotherapeutic regimen targeting CD133 and DNA-PK in combination with traditional protocols may increase chemotherapeutic efficacy and improve prognosis for individuals who present with glioblastoma.",https//www.nature.com/articles/onc201578.pdf
999,Histidine-Rich Glycoprotein Can Prevent Development of Mouse Experimental Glioblastoma,"Glioma is the most common and lethal type of primary brain tumor affecting adults. Gliomas are graded between I-IV following guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO)  . Grade I-II tumors are considered benign and grade III-IV tumors malignant. The prognosis of patients diagnosed with malignant glioma is extremely poor with a median survival of 15 months for grade IV tumors  . Malignant glioma, in particular grade IV tumors (glioblastoma), often display ample microvascular proliferations which consists of multilayered, proliferating endothelial cells.","Extensive angiogenesis, formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels, is an important feature of malignant glioma. Several antiangiogenic drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or its receptors are currently in clinical trials as therapy for high-grade glioma and bevacizumab was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. However, the modest efficacy of these drugs and emerging problems with anti-VEGF treatment resistance welcome the development of alternative antiangiogenic therapies. One potential candidate is histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), a plasma protein with antiangiogenic properties that can inhibit endothelial cell adhesion and migration. We have used the RCAS/TV-A mouse model for gliomas to investigate the effect of HRG on brain tumor development. Tumors were induced with platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), in the presence or absence of HRG. We found that HRG had little effect on tumor incidence but could significantly inhibit the development of malignant glioma and completely prevent the occurrence of grade IV tumors (glioblastoma).",https//storage.googleapis.com/plos-corpus-prod/10.1371/journal.pone.0008536/1/pone.0008536.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=wombat-sa%40plos-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20210302%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20210302T015431Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=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

Its prognosis has remained poor despite numerous efforts to improve survival. Panobinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, is a targeted agent that has recently shown pre-clinical efficacy and entered a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of children with recurrent or progressive DIPG.sA collaborative pre-clinical study was conducted using both a genetic BSG mouse model driven by PDGF-B signaling, p53 loss, and ectopic H3.3-K27M or H3.3-WT expression and an H3.3-K27M orthotopic DIPG xenograft model to confirm and extend previously published findings regarding the efficacy of panobinostat in vitro and in vivo.In vitro, panobinostat potently inhibited cell proliferation, viability, and clonogenicity and induced apoptosis of human and murine DIPG cells.

1077,Molecular genetics of low-grade gliomas genomic alterations guiding diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. 11th Annual Frye-Halloran Brain Tumor Symposium Meeting Report,"he 2012 Frye-Halloran Symposium took place at the Massachusetts General Hospital on October 4, bringing together international experts to address the molecular revolution in the diagnosis and classification of low-grade gliomas. The symposium is an annual event that aims to facilitate the translation of promising innovations from the laboratory to the clinic. Noteworthy past symposia have focused on such topics as the introduction of microdialysis for real-time in situ measurement of activated drugs, the identification of novel MRI findings to track the effects of angiogenesis inhibition, the development of therapies based on viral vectors and cell-based immunizations, and racial diversity in glioma patient populations.","Object. The authors' goal was to review the current understanding of the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in low-grade glioma development and how these mechanisms can be targets for detection and treatment of the disease and its recurrence.s. On October 4, 2012, the authors convened a meeting of researchers and clinicians across a variety of pertinent medical specialties to review the state of current knowledge on molecular genetic mechanisms of low-grade gliomas and to identify areas for further research and drug development.. The meeting consisted of 3 scientific sessions ranging from neuropathology of IDH1 mutations; CIC, ATRX, and FUBP1 mutations in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas; and IDH1 mutations as therapeutic targets. Sessions consisted of a total of 10 talks by international leaders in low-grade glioma research, mutant IDH1 biology and its application in glioma research, and treatment.. The recent discovery of recurrent gene mutations in low-grade glioma has increased the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in a host of biological activities related to low-grade gliomas. Understanding the role these genetic alterations play in brain cancer initiation and progression will help lead to the development of novel treatment modalities than can be personalized to each patient, thereby helping transform this now often-fatal malignancy into a chronic or even curable disease.

1095,High-Density Lipoprotein-Mimicking Nanodiscs for Chemo-immunotherapy against Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Ongoing research has demonstrated that nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit the ability to meet the need for targeted delivery of therapeutics and can also be used as imaging agents (theranostics) in the setting of malignant brain tumors.    NPs have been previously used to co-deliver different agents, such as CpG and paclitaxel (PTX).  However, few NPs have met regulatory approval for clinical administration. HDL is a naturally occurring nanodisc that, unlike many engineered NPs, circulates in plasma for long periods of time (t ½ ~ 3-4 days).  It also plays a major role in cholesterol transport and in the transport of other molecules, such as vitamin E, steroid hormones, signaling lipids, and micro RNAs.    HDL has been utilized for the delivery of small lipophilic or amphiphilic molecules, i.e., taxol, for treating breast, prostate and ovarian cancer;  10-hydroxycamptohecin (HCPT), for treating colon carcinoma;  pimecrolimus and tacrolimus, for treating atopic dermatitis.  Incorporating small molecule drugs into HDLs can improve the therapeutic efficacy by enhancing the small molecule's solubility, circulation half-life, and distribution profile. , ,  Synthetic Apolipoprotein-I (ApoA-I) peptide-based sHDL nanodiscs, which are more cost-effective and easier to produce on a large scale, have been administered to humans in Phase I/II studies and were proven to be well tolerated and safe at high doses.   24 Therefore, HDL is an attractive drug-delivery carrier for glioma therapeutics, capable of overcoming the current challenges encountered by traditional delivery methods, owing to their structural features, biocompatibility and intrinsic targeting ability via receptor-mediated mechanisms.  ,  Due to its small size, HDL NPs can diffuse through the entire solid tumor volume better than other NPs and enhance the accumulation of the cargo in tumor cells.  To test our hypothesis, synthetic high density lipoprotein mimicking nanodiscs (sHDL) that encompass ApoAI mimetic peptide, phospholipids and CpG were developed to effectively deliver chemotherapeutic agents to the GBM TME. We assessed experimentally whether sHDL NP would target GBM in vitro and in vivo, and if sHDL-CpG loaded with chemotherapeutic agents would induce GBM tumor regression and elicit immunological memory in tumor-bearing animals.We also incorporated near-infrared fluorescent dyes and various chemotherapeutic drugs as payloads into sHDL for optical imaging of targeted drug delivery.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor, for which there is no cure. Treatment effectiveness for GBM has been limited due to tumor heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and the presence of the blood-brain barrier, which hampers the transport of chemotherapeutic compounds to the central nervous system (CNS). High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mimicking nanodiscs hold considerable promise to achieve delivery of bioactive compounds into tumors. Herein, we tested the ability of synthetic HDL nanodiscs to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to the GBM microenvironment and elicit tumor regression. To this end, we developed chemo-immunotherapy delivery vehicles based on sHDL nanodiscs loaded with CpG, a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, together with docetaxel (DTX), a chemotherapeutic agent, for targeting GBM. Our data show that delivery of DTX-sHDL-CpG nanodiscs into the tumor mass elicited tumor regression and antitumor CD8(+) T cell responses in the brain TME. We did not observe any overt off-target side effects. Furthermore, the combination of DTX-sHDL-CpG treatment with radiation (IR), which is the standard of care for GBM, resulted in tumor regression and long-term survival in 80% of GBM-bearing animals. Mice remained tumor-free upon tumor cell rechallenge in the contralateral hemisphere, indicating the development of anti-GBM immunological memory. Collectively, these data indicate that sHDL nanodiscs constitute an effective drug delivery platform for the treatment of GBM, resulting in tumor regression, long-term survival, and immunological memory when used in combination with IR. The proposed delivery platform has significant potential for clinical translation.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484828/pdf/nihms-1012787.pdf
1145,The JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor pacritinib effectively inhibits patient-derived GBM brain tumor initiating cells in vitro and when used in combination with temozolomide increases survival in an orthotopic xenograft model,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV astrocytoma, is the most common and lethal central nervous system tumor   . It is a rare disease, with 2-4 new GBM diagnoses per 100,000 in North America every year. The incidence of the disease peaks among those aged 45 to 75 [ . It is estimated that 12,390 new cases of GBM will be diagnosed in the United States in 2017  . The current standard of care involves maximal safe surgical resection of the tumor followed by treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy  . Treatment only modestly improves the outcome of GBM patients, as median survival remains only 14.6 months following diagnosis   . GBM is lethal as it inevitably recurs despite aggressive treatment strategies. Disease recurrence has been postulated to be due to the presence of brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs). BTICs have the cancer stem cell properties of long-term self-renewal, multi-lineage differentiation, and the capability to readily initiate tumors in mice that are similar to the human GBMs from which they were derived   . Therefore, in order to prevent post-treatment recurrence, targeting BTICs is likely a crucial therapeutic strategy to make this devastating disease more manageable.","The prognosis for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains dismal, with current treatment prolonging survival only modestly. As such, there remains a strong need for novel therapeutic strategies. The janus kinase (JAK) 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 pathway regulates many cellular processes in GBM, including survival, proliferation, invasion, anti-apoptosis, and immune evasion. Here, we evaluated the preclinical efficacy of pacritinib, a novel compound targeting JAK2, using a collection of diverse patient-derived brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs).Experimental designThe effects of pacritinib on BTIC viability and sphere forming capacity were evaluated in vitro using the alamarBlue and neurosphere assays, respectively. On-target inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling was investigated using western blotting. The efficacy of pacritinib was tested in vivo in pharmacokinetic analyses, liver microsome analyses, and Kaplan-Meier survival studies.In vitro, pacritinib decreased BTIC viability and sphere forming potential at low micromolar doses and demonstrated on-target inhibition of STAT3 signaling. Additionally, pacritinib was found to improve the response to temozolomide (TMZ) in TMZ-resistant BTICs. In vivo, systemic treatment with pacritinib demonstrated blood-brain barrier penetration and led to improved overall median survival in combination with TMZ, in mice orthotopically xeno-grafted with an aggressive recurrent GBM BTIC culture.This preclinical study demonstrates the efficacy of pacritinib and supports the feasibility of testing pacritinib for the treatment of GBM, in combination with the standard of care TMZ.",https//storage.googleapis.com/plos-corpus-prod/10.1371/journal.pone.0189670/1/pone.0189670.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=wombat-sa%40plos-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20210302%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20210302T015400Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=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

Each drug inhibits one or more important growth-enhancing pathways used by glioblastoma. By blocking survival paths, the aim is to render temozolomide, the current standard cytotoxic drug used in primary glioblastoma treatment, more effective. Although esthetically unpleasing to use so many drugs at once, the closely similar drugs of the original CUSP9 used together have been well-tolerated when given on a compassionate-use basis in the cases that have come to our attention so far.

1295,"Children with DIPG and high-grade glioma treated with temozolomide, irinotecan, and bevacizumab the Seattle Children's Hospital experience","Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG) are aggressive diseases with few long-term survivors  . pHGG encompass several malignancies, with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA; WHO Grade III) and glioblastoma (GBM; WHO grade IV) representing the most common histologies. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a discrete clinical entity arising from the pons included under the umbrella term pHGG, which is universally fatal with a historical median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7 months and median overall survival (OS) of 11.2 months  . Recent molecular discoveries have led to a new World Health Organization (WHO) classification, ""diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27Mmutant"" (DMG), to address the biologic link amongst fatal H3 K27M-mutant glioma of the pons, thalamus, and spinal cord  . The historical median 1-year OS for all pHGG is 69% for AA and 59% for GBM with the vast majority succumbing to their disease within 2 years  . Resection beyond biopsy is impossible in DIPG and often unattainable in other pHGG where lesions are infiltrative and invade critical structures. Ultimately, conformal radiation is the most impactful modality in prolonging survival and re-irradiation is the most efficacious therapy at recurrence     . Decades of research have been devoted to exploring cytotoxic agents as neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant therapies, yielding disappointing results and failing to improve survival         . While infants under 3 years of age with pHGG are often treated with intensive or prolonged post-operative chemotherapy regimens to delay or obviate radiation, children over 3 years of age are most often treated with focal radiotherapy   . Rarely, craniospinal radiation (CSI) is required in the setting of metastatic disease or leptomeningeal dissemination.","Introduction Beyond focal radiation, there is no consensus standard therapy for pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) and outcomes remain dismal. We describe the largest molecularly-characterized cohort of children with pHGG treated with a 3-drug maintenance regimen of temozolomide, irinotecan, and bevacizumab (TIB) following radiation. s We retrospectively reviewed 36 pediatric patients treated with TIB at Seattle Children's Hospital from 2009 to 2018 and analyzed survival using the Kaplan-Meier method. Molecular profiling was performed by targeted DNA sequencing and toxicities, steroid use, and palliative care utilization were evaluated.  Median age at diagnosis was 10.9 years (18 months-18 years). Genetic alterations were detected in 26 genes and aligned with recognized molecular subgroups includingH3 K27M-mutant (12),H3F3AG34-mutant (2),IDH-mutant (4), and hypermutator profiles (4). Fifteen patients (42%) completed 12 planned cycles of maintenance. Side effects associated with chemotherapy delays or modifications included thrombocytopenia (28%) and nausea/vomiting (19%), with temozolomide dosing most frequently modified. Median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was 16.2 and 20.1 months, with shorter survival seen in DIPG (9.3 and 13.3 months, respectively). Survival at 1, 2, and 5 years was 80%, 10% and 0% for DIPG and 85%, 38%, and 16% for other pHGG.  Our single-center experience demonstrates tolerability of this 3-drug regimen, with prolonged survival in DIPG compared to historical single-agent temozolomide. pHGG survival was comparable to analogous 3-drug regimens and superior to historical agents; however, cure was rare. Children with pHGG remain excellent candidates for the study of novel therapeutics combined with standard therapy.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-020-03558-w.pdf
1316,Assessment of therapeutic response and treatment planning for brain tumors using metabolic and physiological MRI,"Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults and originate from the support cells of the brain or neuroglia. The World Health Organization (WHO II) definition of the severity or grade of these lesions (1-4) is based on the degree of malignancy or aggressiveness that is observed in microscopic analysis of biopsy or surgical samples. Criteria that are considered include the level of invasiveness, similarity to normal cells, growth rate and presence of abnormal vascularity     . Grade I tumors are slow growing and are considered to be benign. Grade II tumors are deemed low grade, but exhibit nuclear atypia and can progress if left untreated. Depending on the cell of origin, they may be termed astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma or of mixed type. Grade III tumors have mitotic figures in addition to nuclear atypia, and the most common subtype is anaplastic astrocytoma because of its higher cellularity and increased vascularity. Grade IV gliomas, or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are defined by the existence of regions of necrosis, higher cellularity, increased vascularity and proliferation. Although these histological criteria are well defined, the heterogeneity and infiltrative nature of these tumors mean that biopsy or surgical resection is not always accurate, and samples from the same patient may be classified as corresponding to more than one grade. In such cases, the diagnosis corresponding to the highest observed grade is the one that is used. The availability of noninvasive MR technologies for the assessment of the location and spatial extent of the lesion is a critical factor in making decisions about the management of patients with glioma. The presence of regions with abnormal microvasculature causes breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in grade IV and some grade III gliomas, which appears as regions of contrast enhancement on post-gadolinium T 1 -weighted images (see Fig. 1 ). Regions of necrosis are common for grade IV glioma and may be observed as central areas of hypointense signal on such images. Surrounding regions of infiltrative tumor and edema exhibit hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted images and typically extend over a much larger region of the brain. Grade II and some grade III lesions show reduced or normal vasculature and appear as nonenhancing on post-gadolinium T 1 -weighted images. The situation becomes more complex after therapy as treatment-induced changes may mimic tumor progression in both enhancing and nonenhancing abnormalities. Grade II lesions may become contrast enhancing, and it is difficult to determine from standard imaging criteria alone whether they have transformed to a higher grade     . It is for this reason that recent studies have investigated the use of more advanced imaging methods that are able to monitor physiological and metabolic properties of the tumor and surrounding tissue.","MRI is routinely used for diagnosis, treatment planning and assessment of response to therapy for patients with glioma. Gliomas are spatially heterogeneous and infiltrative lesions that are quite variable in terms of their response to therapy. Patients classified as having low-grade histology have a median overall survival of 7 years or more, but need to be monitored carefully to make sure that their tumor does not upgrade to a more malignant phenotype. Patients with the most aggressive grade IV histology have a median overall survival of 12-15 months and often undergo multiple surgeries and adjuvant therapies in an attempt to control their disease. Despite improvements in the spatial resolution and sensitivity of anatomic images, there remain considerable ambiguities in the interpretation of changes in the size of the gadolinium-enhancing lesion on T-1-weighted images as a measure of treatment response, and in differentiating between treatment effects and infiltrating tumor within the larger T-2 lesion. The planning of focal therapies, such as surgery, radiation and targeted drug delivery, as well as a more reliable assessment of the response to therapy, would benefit considerably from the integration of metabolic and physiological imaging techniques into routine clinical MR examinations. Advanced methods that have been shown to provide valuable data for patients with glioma are diffusion, perfusion and spectroscopic imaging. Multiparametric examinations that include the acquisition of such data are able to assess tumor cellularity, hypoxia, disruption of normal tissue architecture, changes in vascular density and vessel permeability, in addition to the standard measures of changes in the volume of enhancing and nonenhancing anatomic lesions. This is particularly critical for the interpretation of the results of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of novel therapies, which are increasingly including agents that are designed to have anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative properties as opposed to having a direct effect on tumor cell viability.

1354,Analysis of gene expression and chemoresistance of CDI33(+) cancer stem cells in glioblastoma,"Recently, we and other groups have identified a small population of cancer stem cells in adult and pediatric brain tumors     . These cancer stem cells form neurospheres and possess the capacity for self-renewal. They also express genes associated with neural stem cells (NSCs) and differentiate into phenotypically diverse populations including neuronal, astrocytic and oligodendroglial cells. The novel cell-membrane protein CD133, has been identified as a marker of a subset of neural stem cells in the adult central nervous system as well as of glioblastoma stem-like cells   . CD133 positive cancer stem cells have a capacity for unlimited self-renewal, as well as the ability to initiate and drive tumor progression in an animal model  ."," Recently, a small population of cancer stem cells in adult and pediatric brain tumors has been identified. Some evidence has suggested that CD133 is a marker for a subset of leukemia and glioblastoma cancer stem cells. Especially, CD133 positive cells isolated from human glioblastoma may initiate tumors and represent novel targets for therapeutics. The gene expression and the drug resistance property of CD133 positive cancer stem cells, however, are still unknown. In this study, by FACS analysis we determined the percentage of CD133 positive cells in three primary cultured cell lines established from glioblastoma patients 10.2%, 69.7% and 27.5%, respectively. We also determined the average mRNA levels of markers associated with neural precursors. For example, CD90, CD44, CXCR4, Nestin, Msil and MELK mRNA on CD133 positive cells increased to 15.6, 5.7, 337.8, 21.4, 84 and 1351 times, respectively, compared to autologous CD133 negative cells derived from cell line No. 66. Additionally, CD133 positive cells express higher levels of BCRPI and MGMT mRNA, as well as higher mRNA levels of genes that inhibit apoptosis. Furthermore, CD133 positive cells were significantly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents including temozolomide, carboplatin, paclitaxel (Taxol) and etoposide ( VP16) compared to autologous CD133 negative cells. Finally, CD133 expression was significantly higher in recurrent GBM tissue obtained from five patients as compared to their respective newly diagnosed tumors. Our study for the first time provided evidence that CD133 positive cancer stem cells display strong capability on tumor's resistance to chemotherapy. This resistance is probably contributed by the CD133 positive cell with higher expression of on BCRP1 and MGMT, as well as the anti-apoptosis protein and inhibitors of apoptosis protein families. Future treatment should target this small population of CD133 positive cancer stem cells in tumors to improve the survival of brain tumor patients.",https//molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1476-4598-5-67.pdf
1377,Magnetic nanoparticles an emerging technology for malignant brain tumor imaging and therapy,"The emerging field of cancer nanotechnology has stirred interest in the use of nanomaterial platforms for malignant brain tumor therapy. Typically, nanoparticles (NPs) with at least one dimension less than 100 nm have been utilized preclinically and in human clinical trials   . With current engineering advancements, NPs with varying size, shape, composition and surface chemistry are being synthesized and investigated. The development of multifunctional nanoplatforms for brain tumor therapy that can provide the benefit of simultaneous imaging and therapy holds great promise in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant brain tumors. Some of the most commonly used types of NPs that are being explored in the treatment of malignant brain tumors include polymeric particles, micelles  , nanoshells  , quantum dots  and magnetic iron oxide NPs (IONPs)  .","Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) represent a promising nanomaterial for the targeted therapy and imaging of malignant brain tumors. Conjugation of peptides or antibodies to the surface of MNPs allows direct targeting of the tumor cell surface and potential disruption of active signaling pathways present in tumor cells. Delivery of nanoparticles to malignant brain tumors represents a formidable challenge due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier and infiltrating cancer cells in the normal brain. Newer strategies permit better delivery of MNPs systemically and by direct convection-enhanced delivery to the brain. Completion of a human clinical trial involving direct injection of MNPs into recurrent malignant brain tumors for thermotherapy has established their feasibility, safety and efficacy in patients. Future translational studies are in progress to understand the promising impact of MNPs in the treatment of malignant brain tumors.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3461264/pdf/nihms-364845.pdf
1416,Molecular Mechanisms of Treatment Resistance in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, and despite standard-of-care multimodality therapy, including maximal safe resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains almost universally fatal with a mean overall survival of 14 to 20 months  . Since the 2005 pivotal phase III trial by Stupp et al.  , which established the role of concurrent chemoradiation with temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, no chemotherapies investigated in late-phase clinical trials have significantly improved upon this foundational approach. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma on the basis of two phase II studies showing a progressionfree survival benefit. However, two phase III clinical trials evaluating its role in the treatment of newly diagnosed disease did not demonstrate an overall survival benefit when bevacizumab was added to standard therapy    . The FDA also has approved tumor-treating fields therapy (TTF), which consists of low-intensity, alternating electric fields applied to the scalp for most of the day, for use in recurrent (2011) and newly diagnosed (2015) glioblastoma, although widespread adoption of TTF has been limited by methodological concerns about the generalizability of the data from prior studies of it  . Thus, there are currently no effective therapies for glioblastoma. In this review, we discuss the innate mechanisms of treatment resistance common to all glioblastomas before characterizing the various mechanisms of resistance to conventional treatments, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy. The initial obstacle that therapies against malignant gliomas must overcome is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a non-fenestrated physical barrier comprised of specialized capillary endothelial cells interconnected by multi-protein tight junctions consisting of claudins (especially claudin-1, -3, and -5), occludins, and junctional adhesion molecules  . Closely associated with these endothelial cells by virtue of a shared basal lamina are complexes of astrocytic endfeet, pericytes, and intermittent ends of neurons, which collectively constitute the neurovascular unit responsible for maintaining biochemical and physical homeostasis in the normal brain  . The BBB permits only small (<500 Da and <400 nm) and lipophilic molecules to passively diffuse across; other molecules cross the BBB via pinocytosis, receptor-or carrier-mediated transcytosis, and solute-carrier-protein mechanisms  . The integrity of the BBB and homeostatic equilibrium are further bolstered by ATP-binding cassette transporters, such as multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1), P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, and numerous other drug resistance proteins that are expressed on the luminal and abluminal sides of vessel walls (Figure 1 ). These transporters actively mediate the efflux of xenobiotics such as cytotoxic or targeted therapeutic agents out of the brain parenchyma    . Attempts to modulate these efflux pumps have largely been unsuccessful   . ","Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and is almost invariably fatal. Despite our growing understanding of the various mechanisms underlying treatment failure, the standard-of-care therapy has not changed over the last two decades, signifying a great unmet need. The challenges of treating glioblastoma are many and include inadequate drug or agent delivery across the blood-brain barrier, abundant intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity, redundant signaling pathways, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, we review the innate and adaptive molecular mechanisms underlying glioblastoma's treatment resistance, emphasizing the intrinsic challenges therapeutic interventions must overcome-namely, the blood-brain barrier, tumoral heterogeneity, and microenvironment-and the mechanisms of resistance to conventional treatments, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/ijms/ijms-22-00351/article_deploy/ijms-22-00351.pdf
1466,Advances in Experimental Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy for Patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Genome Atlas Research Network consortium carried out multiplatform analysis (DNA mutations, mRNA, microRNA expressions) of 500 tumor tissue samples from patients with untreated primary GBM  . This initiative, together with the other large multiplatform studies, revealed several abnormalities in a diversity of mutated genes and cellular signaling pathways involved in high-grade glioma development and progression      . The most important genetic and epigenetic aberrations were found in following cellular signaling pathways i) Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) oncogenic pathways (88% of GBM), ii) the p53 pathway (87% of GBM), iii) cell-cycle regulatory pathway (78% of GBM), and iv) the newly-discovered alterations in metabolic pathways including isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) mutations (10% of GBM). The mutations in IDH1/2 serve also as an independent and important GBM prognostic factor    . Their routine assessment is now highly recommended in the clinical management of patients with glioma (including GBM) according to the recently updated World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification of CNS tumors    .","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults with generally dismal prognosis, early clinical deterioration and high mortality. GBM is extremely invasive, characterized by intense and aberrant vascularization and high resistance to multimodal treatment. Standard therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide) has very limited effectiveness, with median overall survival of patients no longer than 15 months. Progress in genetics and epigenetics of GBM over the past decade has revealed various aberrations in cellular signaling pathways, the tumor microenvironment, and pathological angiogenesis. A number of targeted anticancer drugs, such as small-molecule kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have been evaluated in clinical trials with newly-diagnosed, as well as recurrent GBM. Unfortunately, to date, only a single anti-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab, has been approved for the treatment of recurrent GBM in the USA and Canada. The novel possibilities of cancer immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, are being evaluated in clinical trials of patients with GBM. The most recent clinical experiences with targeted therapy as well as immunotherapy of GBM are given in this review. The relative lack of success of some of these approaches recently revealed in well-designed randomized clinical trials is also discussed.",https//ar.iiarjournals.org/content/anticanres/37/1/21.full.pdf
1492,Exploration of the gene fusion landscape of glioblastoma using transcriptome sequencing and copy number data,"Cancers result from the accumulation of genomic mutations and epigenetic alterations that change gene expression and function. In particular, gene fusions have been recognized as an associated and significant feature of cancer since the characterization of the Philadelphia chromosome  . The occurrence of gene fusions in solid tumors has long been noted, but their importance has been appreciated only recently, largely due to high throughput technologies such as transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq)     . RNA-seq permits genome-wide transcription analysis for novel transcript discovery."," RNA-seq has spurred important gene fusion discoveries in a number of different cancers, including lung, prostate, breast, brain, thyroid and bladder carcinomas. Gene fusion discovery can potentially lead to the development of novel treatments that target the underlying genetic abnormalities. In this study, we provide comprehensive view of gene fusion landscape in 185 glioblastoma multiforme patients from two independent cohorts. Fusions occur in approximately 30-50% of GBM patient samples. In the Ivy Center cohort of 24 patients, 33% of samples harbored fusions that were validated by qPCR and Sanger sequencing. We were able to identify high-confidence gene fusions from RNA-seq data in 53% of the samples in a TCGA cohort of 161 patients. We identified 13 cases (8%) with fusions retaining a tyrosine kinase domain in the TCGA cohort and one case in the Ivy Center cohort. Ours is the first study to describe recurrent fusions involving non-coding genes. Genomic locations 7p11 and 12q14-15 harbor majority of the fusions. Fusions on 7p11 are formed in focally amplified EGFR locus whereas 12q14-15 fusions are formed by complex genomic rearrangements. All the fusions detected in this study can be further visualized and analyzed using our website http//ivygap.swedish.org/fusions. Our study highlights the prevalence of gene fusions as one of the major genomic abnormalities in GBM. The majority of the fusions are private fusions, and a minority of these recur with low frequency. A small subset of patients with fusions of receptor tyrosine kinases can benefit from existing FDA approved drugs and drugs available in various clinical trials. Due to the low frequency and rarity of clinically relevant fusions, RNA-seq of GBM patient samples will be a vital tool for the identification of patient-specific fusions that can drive personalized therapy.",https//bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2164-14-818.pdf
1541,New perspectives in glioblastoma antiangiogenic therapy,"Glioblastoma (GB), first described in 1926 in the classification of brain tumours by Cushing, is the most common primary brain cancer among adults and the most aggressive malignant brain tumour. GB has an incidence of 1.26  1 (men vs. women) and a median survival rate of 13-16 months after standard therapy consisting of maximal resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Unfortunately, the prognosis is poor with a survival rate of 5% at five years; there is a small increase in the survival rate for patients diagnosed under the age of 20. Only 10% of these types of malignant tumours are secondary neoplasm, evolved from low-grade brain tumours (e.g. anaplastic astrocytoma). The remaining 90% of GB are de novo glioblastoma multiforme and have a rapid progression of only three months, compared with the secondary glioblastoma that has a progression time of 4-5 years    . Glioblastomas are highly vascularised tumours, known to exhibit enhanced infiltrative potential.","Glioblastoma (GB) is highly vascularised tumour, known to exhibit enhanced infiltrative potential. One of the characteristics of glioblastoma is microvascular proliferation surrounding necrotic areas, as a response to a hypoxic environment, which in turn increases the expression of angiogenic factors and their signalling pathways (RAS/RAF/ERK/MAPK pathway, PI3K/Akt signalling pathway and WTN signalling cascade). Currently, a small number of anti-angiogenic drugs, extending glioblastoma patients survival, are available for clinical use. Most medications are ineffective in clinical therapy of glioblastoma due to acquired malignant cells or intrinsic resistance, angiogenic receptors cross-activation and redundant intracellular signalling, or the inability of the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier and to reach its target in vivo. Researchers have also observed that GB tumours are different in many aspects, even when they derive from the same tissue, which is the reason for personalised therapy.An understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating glioblastoma angiogenesis and invasion may be important in the future development of curative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this devastating disease.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4925727/pdf/WO-20-26262.pdf
1556,Phase 1 trial of gefitinib plus sirolimus in adults with recurrent malignant glioma,"Traditional cytotoxic therapies, including external beam radiotherapy (X-ray therapy) and chemotherapy, provide a modest survival advantage for some patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme  . Salvage therapies are ineffective  , and nearly all glioblastoma multiforme patients die within 1 to 2 years of diagnosis. Innovative, more effective treatments are desperately needed for this patient population."," To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of gefitinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor, plus sirolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, among patients with recurrent malignant glioma.Patients and s Gefitinib and sirolimus were administered on a continuous daily dosing schedule at dose levels that were escalated in successive cohorts of malignant glioma patients at any recurrence who were stratified based on concurrent use of CYP3A-inducing anticonvulsants [enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, (EIAED)]. Pharmacokinetic and archival tumor biomarker data were also assessed. Thirty-four patients with progressive disease after prior radiation therapy and chemotherapy were enrolled, including 29 (85%) with glioblastoma multiforme and 5 (15%) with anaplastic glioma. The MTD was 500 mg of gefitinib plus 5 mg of sirolimus for patients not on EIAEDs and 1,000 mg of gefitinib plus 10 mg of sirolimus for patients on EIAEDs. DLTs included mucositis, diarrhea, rash, thrombocytopenia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Gefitinib exposure was not affected by sirolimus administration but was significantly lowered by concurrent EIAED use. Two patients (6%) achieved a partial radiographic response, and 13 patients (38%) achieved stable disease. We show that gefitinib plus sirolimus can be safely coadministered on a continuous, daily dosing schedule, and established the recommended dose level of these agents in combination for future phase 2 clinical trials.",https//clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/12/3/860.full.pdf
1608,"Targeted Therapeutics in Patients With High-Grade Gliomas Past, Present, and Future","Despite years of basic research and clinical trials, glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the deadliest primary brain tumors in adults. Standard treatments for GBM and other high-grade gliomas with a survival benefit in randomized studies include maximal safe surgical resection, radiation, chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ)  , and, more recently, tumor-treating fields  . Despite these treatment advances, only ∼15-20 % of GBM patients survive to 5 years, and no therapies have demonstrated a durable survival benefit in recurrent disease   . GBMs are part of a broader category of diffusely infiltrating gliomas consisting of grades II through IV tumors. Gliomas have historically been classified and treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2007 criteria, which are based on histopathology  . In this scheme, the highgrade gliomas are composed of grade III gliomas (anaplastic astrocytomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas) and grade IV GBMs. Most GBMs are primary, but 20 % are secondary with malignant transformation from lower-grade gliomas (sometimes called secondary GBMs).","High-grade gliomas remain incurable despite current therapies, which are plagued by high morbidity and mortality. Molecular categorization of glioma subtypes using mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2), TP53, and ATRX; codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q; DNA methylation; and amplification of genes such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide provides a more accurate prognostication and biologic classification than classical histopathological diagnoses, and a number of molecular markers are being incorporated in the new World Health Organization classification of gliomas. However, despite the improved understanding of the molecular subtypes of gliomas and the underlying alterations in specific signaling pathways, these observations have so far failed to result in the successful application of targeted therapies, as has occurred in other solid tumors. To date, the only targeted therapy for gliomas approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is bevacizumab, which targets vascular endothelial growth factor. EGFR remains a dominant molecular alteration in specific glioma subtypes and represents a potentially promising target, with drugs of multiple types targeting EGFR in development including vaccines, antibody drug conjugates, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, despite the prior failures of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Immune therapies under investigation include checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines against tumor-associated antigens and tumor-specific antigens, pulsed dendritic cells, heat shock protein-tumor conjugates, and CAR T cells. Mutations in the IDH1/2 genes are central to gliomagenesis in a high proportion of grade II and III gliomas, and ongoing trials are examining vaccines against IDH1, small molecular inhibitors of IDH1 and IDH2, and metabolic components including NAD+ depletion to target IDH-mutated gliomas. The central role of DNA methylation in a subset of gliomas may be targetable, but better understanding of the relation between epigenetic alterations and resulting tumor biology appears necessary. Ultimately, given the prior failure of single-agent targeted therapy in high-grade gliomas, it appears that novel combinatorial therapy or targeted drugs with immunomodulatory or epigenetic approaches will likely be necessary to successfully combat these challenging tumors.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11864-016-0418-0.pdf
1628,Localized targeted antiangiogenic drug delivery for glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), recognized as one of the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumors, has an incidence rate of three cases per 100,000 persons in the middle-aged population    . After maximal surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, the median survival is between 14 and months   . The outlook is even worse for recurrent GBM, with a progression free survival of only 6.9 months after tumor recurrence   . Treatment options for recurrent GBM are varied, and include assorted chemotherapeutic regimens, re-resection, and recently, tumor treatment fields with radio waves  . Despite these standard treatment options, recurrence is almost inevitable  . Being a highly vascular tumor, GBM is characterized by extensive proliferation of blood vessels through various cellular pathways such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and interleukin 8 (IL-8)   . Studies have considered a number of novel treatment approaches over the years such as the application of antiangiogenic agents like Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF, for systemic GBM therapy.  yielding prolonged progression free survival was promising, but unfortunately minimal improvements in overall survival were achieved in patients receiving Bevacizumab as a single agent or in combination therapy     . In addition, dose limiting systemic toxicities including hypertension, arterial thromboembolic events, proteinuria, bowel perforation, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, wound complications and hemorrhage were seen among Bevacizumab treatment groups  . A factor that commonly contributes to poor treatment response in the central nervous system is the limited permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB)  . In GBM, the BBB is partially disrupted in the tumor core but the majority remains intact, forming a strong protective barrier between the tumor and the outside environment. This makes it difficult to deliver these treatment agents at a sufficient dose for effectiveness without also creating serious toxicity  1 .","Systemic delivery of antiangiogenic agents has been ineffective in improving the overall survival of patients with both primary and recurrent glioblastoma, in part due to dose-limiting toxicities. With the development of new and efficient localized delivery methods and vehicles, an otherwise lethal dose of antiangiogenic chemotherapy can be used to treat tumors while minimizing systemic side effects. Current in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies have shown promising results that encourage the pursuit towards human clinical trials for localized antiangiogenic treatment in the near future.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-018-2747-2.pdf
1651,Phase I Pharmacokinetic Study of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Vatalanib (PTK787) Plus Imatinib and Hydroxyurea for Malignant Glioma,"The current standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary adult central nervous system tumor, includes radiotherapy plus temozolomide (TMZ), based on a modest survival benefit compared with radiotherapy alone. However, recurrence remains universal, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of only 6.9 months. 1 Patients with grade malignant glioma (MG) fare somewhat better, with median survival between 2 and 5 years. 2 After recurrence, there is no established, effective treatment. Therefore, more active therapies to improve survival for newly diagnosed MG patients and beneficial salvage therapies for patients following progression are critically needed.","BACKGROUND This study determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of the oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor, vatalanib, when administered with imatinib and hydroxyurea on a continuous daily schedule among recurrent malignant glioma patients. METHODS All patients received 500 mg of hydroxyurea twice daily. Imatinib was dosed at 400 mg per day for patients not taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs; stratum A) and at 500 mg twice-a-day for patients taking EIAEDs (stratum B). Vatalanib was escalated from 500 mg to 1250 mg twice daily in successive cohorts, independently for each stratum. Pharmacokinetics of each drug were assessed. RESULTS A total of 37 recurrent patients, 34 (92%) with glioblastoma and 3 (8%) with grade 3 malignant glioma, were enrolled. Nineteen patients (51%) were taking EIAEDs. The MTD of vatalanib for all patients was 1000 mg twice-a-day. DLTs were hematologic, gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic. No patients developed intracranial hemorrhage. Concurrent administration of imatinib and hydroxyurea did not affect vatalanib exposure, but EIAEDs decreased vatalanib and imatinib plasma exposures. CONCLUSIONS Vatalanib doses up to 1000 mg twice-a-day combined with imatinib and hydroxyurea were well tolerated. Strategies to target tumor blood vessel endothelial cells and pericytes by inhibiting VEGFR and platelet-derived growth factor, respectively, were safe among recurrent malignant glioma patients and may enhance antiangiogenesis activity.

Using an integrative genetic analysis of 53 pediatric glioblastomas and five in vitro model systems, we identified previously unidentified gene fusions involving the MET oncogene in ~10% of cases. These MET fusions activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and, in cooperation with lesions compromising cell cycle regulation, induced aggressive glial tumors in vivo. MET inhibitors suppressed MET tumor growth in xenograft models. Finally, we treated a pediatric patient bearing a MET-fusion-expressing glioblastoma with the targeted inhibitor crizotinib. This therapy led to substantial tumor shrinkage and associated relief of symptoms, but new treatment-resistant lesions appeared, indicating that combination therapies are likely necessary to achieve a durable clinical response.","Pediatric glioblastoma is one of the most common and most deadly brain tumors in childhood.

1693,Emerging Clinical Principles on the Use of Bevacizumab for the Treatment of Malignant Gliomas,"chemotherapy, as an active treatment option for patients with recurrent GB who have failed previous TMZ therapy,  leading to the recent US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of single-agent bevacizumab in previously treated GB.  Preliminary efficacy and safety data describing bevacizumab-based therapy in recurrent AG and additional neuro-oncology treatment settings, although emerging, also are of interest. This review will provide an overview of the role of angiogenesis in HGG and the development of bevacizumab-based treatment, the clinical efficacy and safety data on bevacizumab in this tumor setting, practical insights into bevacizumab administration, and a forward outlook on bevacizumab in other brain tumor treatment settings.","Despite advances in adjuvant therapy, the prognosis for most patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) is poor, and almost all HGGs have a likelihood of disease recurrence. HGGs are highly vascularized tumors with elevated expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an important mediator of angiogenesis. A compelling biologic rationale, a pressing need for improved therapeutics and positive results from studies of bevacizumab in other tumor types, led to the evaluation of bevacizumab in the treatment of HGG. It was demonstrated previously that bevacizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, improved outcomes when combined with chemotherapy (most commonly irinotecan) in patients with recurrent HGG; and, on the basis of an improved objective response rate in 2 prospective phase 2 studies, bevacizumab was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration as a single agent in patients with previously treated glioblastoma (GB). Bevacizumab-containing therapy has been associated with manageable, class-specific toxicity; however, severe treatment-related adverse events are observed in a minority of patients. Preliminary data on bevacizumab-based therapy in recurrent anaplastic gliomas, in the frontline treatment of GB, and in additional patient populations are also encouraging. With the goal of addressing unanswered questions regarding the optimal use of bevacizumab, the objective of the current review was to provide a summary of the clinical efficacy and safety data on bevacizumab in patients with HGG, the practical issues surrounding the administration of bevacizumab, and ongoing investigations of bevacizumab in additional brain tumor treatment settings.

1720,"Targeting NEK2 attenuates glioblastoma growth and radioresistance by destabilizing histone methyltransferase EZH2 (Retracted article. See vol. 130, pg. 6187, 2020)","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with a median overall survival of less than 2 years after diagnosis, even with maximal therapy   . Survival rates for patients with GBM are dismal, with 2-year survival rates ranging from 26% to 33% and 5-year survival rates below 5%   . The standard treatment for GBM includes maximal safe surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ)    . However, life-threatening tumor recurrences are inevitable in the vast majority of patients given the best available treatments   . Recent studies have shown that, like some other malignant tumors, GBM exhibits a large range of phenotypic, molecular, and cellular heterogeneity, and a small subpopulation of tumor cells, termed glioma stem cells (GSCs), is responsible for tumorigenesis, treatment resistance, and subsequent tumor recurrence   . Therefore, it is critical to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of the characteristics of the GSC population and the resistance of these cells to radiotherapy or chemotherapy.","Accumulating evidence suggests that glioma stem cells (GSCs) are important therapeutic targets in glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we identified NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) as a functional binding protein of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) that plays a critical role in the posttranslational regulation of EZH2 protein in GSCs. NEK2 was among the most differentially expressed kinase-encoding genes in GSC-containing cultures (glioma spheres), and it was required for in vitro clonogenicity, in vivo tumor propagation, and radioresistance. Mechanistically, the formation of a protein complex comprising NEK2 and EZH2 in glioma spheres phosphorylated and then protected EZH2 from ubiquitination-dependent protein degradation in a NEK2 kinase activity-dependent manner. Clinically, NEK2 expression in patients with glioma was closely associated with EZH2 expression and correlated with a poor prognosis. NEK2 expression was also substantially elevated in recurrent tumors after therapeutic failure compared with primary untreated tumors in matched GBM patients. We designed a NEK2 kinase inhibitor, compound 3a (CMP3a), which efficiently attenuated GBM growth in a mouse model and exhibited a synergistic effect with radiotherapy. These data demonstrate a key role for NEK2 in maintaining GSCs in GBM by stabilizing the EZH2 protein and introduce the small-molecule inhibitor CMP3a as a potential therapeutic agent for GBM.",https//dm5migu4zj3pb.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/89000/89092/JCI89092.v2.pdf
1752,O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase as a promising target for the treatment of temozolomide-resistant gliomas,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent currently used as first-line therapy for gliomas treatment due to its DNA-damaging effect. Resistance to TMZ emerges with prolonged treatment, mainly due to O  -methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), which repairs O -methylguanine (O  -meG) lesion by transferring the alkyl group from guanine to a cysteine residue, which posts a major therapeutic challenge. Inhibition of MGMT with several O  -guanine derivatives and related compounds has been explored and shown to enhance TMZ-induced cytotoxicity in cancer cells. There is a challenge in overcoming dose-limiting myelosuppressive toxicity of TMZ while maintaining its efficacy. Well-designed clinical trials showing that inhibition of MGMT is clinically beneficial for patients with gliomas are lacking.","Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent currently used as first-line therapy for gliomas treatment due to its DNA-damaging effect. However, drug resistance occurs, preventing multi-cycle use of this chemotherapeutic agent. One of the major mechanisms of cancer drug resistance is enhanced activity of a DNA repair enzyme, O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), which counteracts chemotherapy-induced DNA alkylation and is a key component of chemoresistance. MGMT repairs TMZ-induced DNA lesions, O-6-meG, by transferring the alkyl group from guanine to a cysteine residue. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the field, with particular emphasis on the inhibitors of MGMT and underlying mechanisms. Literature search was performed through PubMed and all relevant articles were reviewed, with particular attention to MGMT, its role in TMZ-resistant gliomas, effects of MGMT inhibitors and the underlying mechanisms. Several strategies are currently being pursued to improve the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ via inhibition of MGMT to reduce chemoresistance and improve overall survival. MGMT may be a promising target for the treatment of TMZ-resistant gliomas.",https//www.nature.com/articles/cddis2013388.pdf
1770,The role of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 in the breast cancer cell response to DNA-damaging agents,"Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and the second leading cause of cancer-related death among females worldwide.   Although the five-year survival rate for cancer confined to the breast has increased to about 80-90% in the last decade, approximately one-third of all breast cancer patients still die from the disease because metastatic breast cancer remains generally incurable.  DNA-damaging therapy, including radiotherapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy, is an important weapon against advanced breast cancer. However, cancer cells frequently develop resistance to either ionizing radiation or cytotoxic agents, and the precise mechanism by which they do so is still unclear. There is increasing evidence that the receptor tyrosine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has an important role in this process. EGFR has been shown to confer tumor resistance to radiotherapy through radiation-induced nuclear translocation of the receptor and its interaction with the DNAdependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex, a key component of the DNA repair pathway. Targeting the DNA repair function of EGFR may serve as a therapeutic model for sensitizing tumors to radiotherapy in patients.  However, only limited benefit has been obtained from combining the treatment with EGFR inhibitors, and overall response rates are still low in most patients.   Therefore, further studies are necessary to determine if other signaling pathways may oppose the DNA-damaging process.","Following exposure to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can modulate the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) by forming protein complexes that include the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). This is one of the key mechanism by which tumors become resistant to DNA-damaging therapies. Our previous studies have shown that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a substrate for DNA-PKcs, and can transactivate EGFR. We therefore questioned whether IGFBP-3 might interact with the EGFR - DNA-PK complex that regulates the DNA damage response. The aim of this study was to delineate the role of IGFBP-3 in the response of breast cancer cells to DSB-inducing chemotherapeutic agents. In the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T, which express IGFBP-3 highly, nuclear localization of EGFR and IGFBP-3 was enhanced by treatment with cytotoxic drugs etoposide or doxorubicin and reduced by the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Enhanced association among IGFBP-3, EGFR and DNA-PKcs, following the exposure to DNA-damaging drugs was supported by both co-immunoprecipitation analysis and direct visualization by proximity ligation assay. The activation of DNA-PKcs at Ser2056, DNA repair as measured by a nonhomologous end-joining assay, and the increase in EGFR and DNA-PKcs interaction induced by DNA-damaging agents, were all decreased by IGFBP-3 silencing, suggesting that IGFBP-3 has an obligatory role in the DNA repair response to DNA-damaging therapy. In conclusion, IGFBP-3 co-translocation to the nucleus of breast cancer cells and its formation of a complex with DNA-PKcs and EGFR in response to DNA damage shows its potential involvement in the regulation of DNA repair. This suggests the possibility of a therapeutic approach for sensitizing breast cancer to chemo-or radiotherapy by targeting the DNA repair function of IGFBP-3.",https//www.nature.com/articles/onc2012538.pdf
1801,"A phase 2 study of the first imipridone ONC201, a selective DRD2 antagonist for oncology, administered every three weeks in recurrent glioblastoma","Glioblastoma is the most frequent adult primary malignant brain tumor. FDA-approved treatment options remain few and the prognosis remains dismal with a median survival of 14.6 months  and a 5-year-survival rate of 9.8%  . In IDH wild-type tumors, MGMT gene promoter methylation status is the most significant prognostic factor for overall survival with extent of resection, corticosteroid use, and number of lesions also possessing prognostic significance. Standard treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery followed by concomitant radiation and temozolomide followed by maintenance temozolomide for 6 months. Unfortunately, this regimen can be associated with toxicity that is particularly problematic for elderly patients who frequently experience neurotoxicity and Grade 3-4 hematological toxicities  . Recurrent glioblastoma has no approved therapy that has been shown to prolong survival in a prospective study. Clearly, new therapies are needed for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.","ONC201 is an oral, small molecule selective antagonist of the G protein-coupled receptor DRD2 that causes p53-independent apoptosis in tumor cells via integrated stress response activation and Akt/ERK inactivation. We performed a Phase II study that enrolled 17 patients with recurrent, bevacizumab-naive, IDH1/2 WT glioblastoma who received 625mg ONC201 every three weeks. Median OS was 41.6 weeks with OS6 of 71% and OS9 of 53%. Seven of 17 patients are alive. PFS6 was 11.8% with two patients remaining on study who continue to receive ONC201 for > 12 months. One of these patients had a durable objective response with a secondary glioblastoma possessing a H3.3 K27M mutation, exhibiting regression by 85% in one lesion and 76% in the second lesion. The second patient who continues to receive ONC201 for > 12 months remains disease-free after enrolling on this trial following a re-resection. No drug-related SAEs or treatment discontinuation due to toxicity occurred. Plasma PK at 2 hours post-dose was 2.6 ug/mL, serum prolactin induction was observed as a surrogate marker of target engagement, and DRD2 was expressed in all evaluated archival tumor specimens. In summary, ONC201 is well tolerated and may have single agent activity in recurrent glioblastoma patients.",https//www.oncotarget.com/article/17837/pdf/

TMZ combined with radiotherapy improves glioblastoma patient survival rates and prolongs the progression-free survival compared with radiation therapy alone  . It is currently the preferred first line chemotherapeutic drug in combination with radiation in the treatment for glioblastoma. However, the five-year survival rate after the diagnosis is still less than 8 % under current standard therapy    ."," Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly primary brain tumor in adults. Low-dose, metronomic (LDM) temozolomide (TMZ) displays improved efficacy in the treatment of glioblastoma by targeting angiogenesis, but has a limited effect on recurrence. The antiangiogenesis drug ginsenoside Rg3 (RG3) is the main active ingredient of ginseng, a popular herbal medicine.s Using an in vitro and a rat model of an orthotopic glioma allograft, this study was to determine whether RG3 enhanced the antiangiogenesis activity of LDM TMZ in the treatment of glioblastoma. Our results showed that combined use of TMZ with RG3 displayed additive inhibition on proliferation of both human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and rat C6 glioma cells in vitro. They additively arrested cell cycle, increased apoptosis, and decreased VEGF-A and BCL-2 expression in HUVEC. Antiangiogenesis effect was also evaluated in the rat model of orthotopic glioma allograft, based upon markers including relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), VEGF levels and microvessel density (MVD)/CD34 staining. LDM TMZ alone was potent in suppressing angiogenesis and tumor growth, whereas RG3 alone only had modest antiangiogenesis effects. Combined treatment significantly and additively suppressed angiogenesis, without additive inhibitory effects on allografted tumor growth. These data provide evidence showing the efficacy of LDM TMZ on glioma treatment. The combined additive antiangiogenesis effect suggests that RG3 has the potential to further increase the efficacy of LDM TMZ in the treatment of glioblastoma.",https//jeccr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13046-015-0274-y.pdf
1865,A novel stem cell culture model of recurrent glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is a highly aggressive astrocytic tumor (WHO grade IV), with uniformly fatal prognosis  . GBM is pathologically characterized by nuclear pleomorphism, microvascular proliferation and necrosis, and displays great inter-tumoral cellular heterogeneity    . Despite multimodal therapy, consisting of surgical resection followed by chemo and radiotherapy, patients typically experience tumor relapse at 9 months and median survival remains around 15 months  . At the genetic level, this heterogeneity has been classified into molecular subgroups, based on differential transcriptome profiling of hundreds of GBMs by the TCGA   . At the cellular level, this heterogeneity can be explained by the existence of multiple cellular subpopulations of cancer cells that have acquired stem cell properties, variably labeled in the literature as brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) or glioblastoma initiating cells (GICs)   . Since cell surface markers allow sorting of bulk GBM into cellular subpopulations, much research has focused on the application of proteins such as CD133 [ , CD15  , integrin alpha6  and L1CAM  to define functional BTSC subgroups. In addition, intracellular proteins such as RNA binding protein Musashi-1  , transcription factor Sox2  and polycomb repressor Bmi1  that have a characterized functional role in driving normal neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal, have also been investigated as putative BTSC markers  1 . Although recent data suggests that CD133? GBM BTSCs are chemo-  and radioresistant [1 , no study has prospectively identified whether such BTSCs are causal of tumor relapse, and whether the same BTSC populations that drive tumor initiation also drive recurrence.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults with average disease relapse at 9 months and median survival rarely extending beyond 15 months. Brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) have been implicated in not only initiating GBM but also conferring resistance to therapy. However, it is not clear whether the BTSC population that initiates tumor growth is also responsible for GBM recurrence. In this study, we have developed a novel in vitro treatment model to profile the evolution of primary treatment-na < ve GBM BTSCs through chemoradiotherapy. We report that our in vitro model enriched for a CD15+/CD133- BTSC population, mirroring the phenotype of BTSCs in recurrent GBM. We also show that in vitro treatment increased stem cell gene expression as well as self-renewal capacity of primary GBMs. In addition, the chemoradiotherapy-refractory gene signature obtained from gene expression profiling identified a hyper-aggressive subtype of glioma. The delivery of in vitro chemoradiotherapy to primary GBM BTSCs models several aspects of recurrent GBM biology, and could be used as a discovery and drug-screening platform to uncover new biological drivers and therapeutic targets in GBM.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-015-1951-6.pdf
1893,"Depatuxizumab Mafodotin (ABT-414)-induced Glioblastoma Cell Death Requires EGFR Overexpression, but not EGFR(Y1)(068) Phosphorylation","Glioblastoma is an invariably fatal brain tumor. Median survival is in the range of 12-15 months. The current standard-of-care includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy using concomitant and maintenance temozolomide (TMZ/RT!TMZ; ref. 1). Accordingly, glioblastoma remains a disease area of high unmet clinical need.","Glioblastomas commonly (40%) exhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification; half of these tumors carry the EGFRvIII deletion variant characterized by an in-frame deletion of exons 2-7, resulting in constitutive EGFR activation. Although EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors had only modest effects in glioblastoma, novel therapeutic agents targeting amplified EGFR or EGFRvIII continue to be developed.Depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414) is an EGFR-targeting antibody-drug conjugate consisting of the mAb 806 and a toxic payload, monomethyl auristatin F. Because glioma cell lines and patient-derived glioma-initiating cell models expressed too little EGFR in vitro to be ABT-414-sensitive, we generated glioma sublines overexpressing EGFR or EGFRvIII to explore determinants of ABT-414-induced cell death.Overexpression of EGFRvIII induces sensitization to ABT-414 more readily than overexpression of EGFR in vitro and in vivo.Exposure to ABT-414 in vivo eliminated EGFRvIII-expressing tumor cells, and recurrent tumors were devoid of EGFRvIII expression. There is no bystander killing of cells devoid of EGFR expression. Surprisingly, either exposure to EGF or to EGFR tyrosin kinase inhibitors reduce EGFR protein levels and are thus not strategies to promote ABT-414-induced cell killing. Furthermore, glioma cells overexpressing kinase-dead EGFR or EGFRvIII retain binding of mAb 806 and sensitivity to ABT-414, allowing to dissociate EGFR phosphorylation from the emergence of the ""active"" EGFR conformation required for ABT-414 binding.The combination of EGFR-targeting antibody-drug conjugates with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors carries a high risk of failure. Promoting EGFR expression rather than phosphorylation should result in glioblastoma cell sensitization to ABT-414.",https//mct.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanther/19/6/1328.full.pdf
1932,Prospects of immune checkpoint modulators in the treatment of glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary tumour of the CNS in adults, representing approximately 50% of all gliomas and 5% of primary brain tumours.

Despite advances in therapy, such as the widespread adoption of temozolomide for chemotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma in 00   improvements in survival for patients with glioblastoma have been modest.   The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is maximal resection of the tumour, followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide.  Unfortunately, glioblastoma ultimately relapses in almost all patients, and none of the current treatments can effectively prolong survival after relapse. Consequently, given the poor prognosis and limited treatment options for patients with glioblastoma, considerable interest has been directed in the development of new therapeutic approaches for this disease.","Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumour in adults. Prognosis is poor even with the current gold-standard first-line treatment-maximal safe resection and combination of radiotherapy with temozolomide chemotherapy-the median overall survival time is only approximately 15-17 months, because the tumour recurs in virtually all patients, and no commonly accepted standard treatment for recurrent disease exists. Several targeted agents have failed to improve patient outcomes in glioblastoma. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab has provided relevant clinical improvements in other advanced tumours for which conventional therapies have had limited success, making immunotherapy an appealing strategy in glioblastoma. This Review summarizes current knowledge on immune checkpoint modulators and evaluates their potential role in glioblastoma on the basis of preclinical studies and emerging clinical data. Furthermore, we discuss challenges that need to be considered in the clinical development of drugs that target immune checkpoint pathways in glioblastoma, such as specific properties of the immune system in the CNS, issues with radiological response assessment, and potential interactions with established and emerging treatment strategies.",https//www.nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2015.139.pdf
1957,Neurooncology clinical trial design for targeted therapies Lessons learned from the North American Brain Tumor Consortium,"ver the last decade, increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of glioma formation and progression has led to exploration of novel therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcome. Early phase I and II clinical trials are designed and conducted to assess the safety, toxicity, and efficacy of these strategies. To date, Copyright 2008 by the Society for Neuro-Oncology however, minimal antitumor activity has been demonstrated using the single-targeted-agent approach in neurooncology.    Challenges in the evaluation of targeted agents have been previously identified,       and in this review we focus on the North American Brain Tumor Consortium (NABTC) experience testing these agents to learn from this effort and to highlight areas for potential improvement in clinical trial design.","The North American Brain Tumor Consortium (NABTC) is a multi-institutional consortium with the primary objective of evaluating novel therapeutic strategies through early phase clinical trials. The NABTC has made substantial changes to the design and methodology of its trials since its inception in 1994. These changes reflect developments in technology, new types of therapies, and advances in our understanding of tumor biology and biological markers. We identify the challenges of early clinical assessment of therapeutic agents by reviewing the clinical trial effort of the NABTC and the evolution of the protocol template used to design trials. To better prioritize effort and allocation of patient resources and funding, we propose an integrated clinical trial design for the early assessment of efficacy of targeted therapies in neurooncology. This design would mandate tissue acquisition prior to therapeutic intervention with the drug, allowing prospective evaluation of its effects. It would also include a combined phase 0/I pharmacokinetic study to determine the safety and biologically optimal dose of the agent and to verify successful modulation of the target prior to initiating a larger, phase II efficacy study.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2666238/pdf/neu-10-4-631.pdf
1982,"Safety, feasibility, and optimization of intra-arterial mitoxantrone delivery to gliomas","Mitoxantrone is semi-synthetic non-cell cycle specific antimitotic drug that has been used for the treatment of solid tumors     . It is poorly lipid soluble and thus has limited efficacy in the brain when delivered systemically. Locoregional delivery of mitoxantrone has been shown to be effective in both experimental and human glioma studies       . Loco-regional delivery has several disadvantages, however, stemming from the need for direct tumor access. Intra-arterial (IA) delivery is an alternative, minimally invasive strategy that may be useful for targeting mitoxantrone to brain tumors.","Mitoxantrone is a highly cytotoxic antineoplastic drug, however, its poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier has limited its role in the treatment of brain cancers. We hypothesize that intra-arterial (IA) delivery of mitoxantrone may enhance its capacity for regional brain deposition thus expanding its potential as a brain tumor therapy agent. In this study we assessed the dose-response characteristics as well as the feasibility and safety of mitoxantrone delivery to the brain and specifically to gliomas in a rodent model. We show that delivery optimization utilizing the technique of intra-arterial transient cerebral hypoperfusion (IA-TCH) facilitates achieving the highest peak- and end- brain drug concentrations as compared to intravenous and IA delivery without hypoperfusion. Additionally, we observed significant tumor-specific uptake of mitoxantrone when delivered by the IA-TCH method. No untoward effects of IA-TCH delivery of mitoxantrone were observed. The IA-TCH method is shown to be a safely tolerated and feasible strategy for delivering mitoxantrone to tumors in the glioma model tested.

2003,EGFR as a Target for Glioblastoma Treatment An Unfulfilled Promise,"Targeting the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGFR) has been rewarding in cancer and many pharmaceuticals are approved alone or in combination with chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer, among others, but not for gliomas  . The approved agents are mostly tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) interfering with the receptor signaling, or monoclonal antibodies targeting the receptor at the cell surface to interfere with ligand binding (Fig. 1) . It remains unresolved why EGFR targeting has not been successful for glioma as it should be ideally suitable in the context of this disease. EGFR was the first molecule to be linked to oncogenesis in glioblastoma  . During the time of the first oncogene descriptions, its gene became linked to a viral oncogene-v-erb B. Massive amplification of that gene was found in glioblastoma  and somatic copy number alterations are present in 43% of patients  . In addition, subsequently numerous mutations including constitutively active truncations and an in-frame deletion leading to constitutive activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase were described as well as the numerous diverse intracellular signaling consequences  . Overall, about 60% of glioblastoma patients have some kind of genomic alteration affecting this pathway  . Of particular interest became the vIII mutation, which results in a molecule with an altered amino-acid sequence, giving rise to a unique site of antigenicity  . In many correlative analyses of EGFR status in clinical trials for glioblastoma, it was reported to be prognostically relevant  , although a larger metaanalysis failed to confirm that overall  . In all large genome-wide cancer studies it turned out to be a key molecule for glioma  as well as for other tumor entities. Therefore, because of being a 'signature molecule' for glioblastoma, EGFR was thought to be an ideal target for therapy   .","The receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGFR) is a prime target for cancer therapy across a broad variety of tumor types. As it is a tyrosine kinase, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting signal transduction, as well as monoclonal antibodies against the EGFR, have been investigated as anti-tumor agents. However, despite the long-known enigmatic EGFR gene amplification and protein overexpression in glioblastoma, the most aggressive intrinsic human brain tumor, the potential of EGFR as a target for this tumor type has been unfulfilled. This review analyses the attempts to use TKIs and monoclonal antibodies against glioblastoma, with special consideration given to immunological approaches, the use of EGFR as a docking molecule for conjugates with toxins, T-cells, oncolytic viruses, exosomes and nanoparticles.

2030,Designer Therapies for Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumors in adults. The incidence of GBM is three per 100,000 person-years in the United States. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, GBM is characterized as grade IV astrocytoma with pathologic hallmarks of necrosis and vascular proliferation. GBMs represent highly lethal cancers associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In a Swiss population-based study, the survival rate of patients with newly diagnosed GBM was approximately 18% at 1 year and only % at  years.  Despite available state-of-the-art multimodality treatments, the median survival of GBM patients is 1-1 months.  Favorable prognostic factors include young age, absent or minimal neurological signs, complete surgical resection, and good performance status.  Current standard-of-care therapies include surgery; radiation; and more recently, concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Recent elucidation of molecular abnormalities underlying glioma pathogenesis has led to several new therapeutic approaches, which include targeting specific oncogenic signaling elements by molecularly targeted therapy (designer drugs), immunotherapy, and gene therapy.  Also, strategies to enhance delivery of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system, which include local polymer administration, convection-enhanced delivery (CED), and other new delivery systems such as nanoparticles, may increase therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances in the development of new targeted therapy in GBM.","Primary brain tumors account for less than 2% of all cancers in adults; however, they are often associated with neurologic morbidity and high mortality. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been a focus of new therapy development in neurooncology because it is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Standard-of-care therapy for newly diagnosed GBM includes surgical resection, radiotherapy, and temozolomide, administered both during and after radiotherapy. However, most patients develop tumor recurrence or progression after this multimodality treatment. Repeat resection and stereotactic radiosurgery upon recurrence may improve outcome only in selected patients. Most salvage chemotherapies offer only palliation. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular abnormalities of GBM have generated new therapeutic venues of molecularly targeted agents (designer drugs) against key components of cellular pathways critical for cancer initiation and maintenance. Such drugs may offer the potential advantage to increase therapeutic efficacy and decrease systemic toxicity compared with traditional cytotoxic agents. Nonetheless, first-generation targeted agents have failed to demonstrate survival benefits in unselected GBM patient populations. Several mechanisms of treatment failure of the first-generation designer drugs have been proposed, whereas new strategies have been developed to increase effectiveness of these agents.

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the OIP5 contribution to GBM tumorigenesis and assess the role of OIP5 in GBM cell response to lomustine, an alkylating agent used in the treatment of this malignancy. So, the effect of OIP5 knockdown was evaluated in A172 and T98G GBM cell lines. Our results demonstrated that downregulation of the OIP5 stimulates glioma cell viability and inhibits cell death-induced necrosis prompted by lomustine.

2107,Sprague Dawley Rag2-Null Rats Created from Engineered Spermatogonial Stem Cells Are Immunodeficient and Permissive to Human Xenografts,"Preclinical research and drug discovery rely heavily on in vitro systems and animal models for safety and efficacy studies. However, in vitro and animal models do not always accurately predict human metabolism and toxicity      . As a result, there have been cases in which a drug was deemed safe or efficacious in rodent studies, but which failed in clinical trials in humans     . Immunodeficient mouse models of human cancer have paved the way for studying cancer biology, genomics, effects on cancer growth kinetics, propensity for metastasis, and treatment response. A plethora of genetically immunodeficient mouse models, with varying immune phenotypes, exist for such studies  . However, drug efficacy testing and downstream analysis such as pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies are limited because of inconsistent or poor tumor engraftment, high variability in tumor growth kinetics, and limited tumor growth potential. As a result, a significantly large number of mice are used for drug efficacy screening in order to achieve a cohort of animals with tumors of similar size and similar tumor growth kinetics for treatment. We explored whether these cell lines might grow more consistently in a versatile in vivo model such as the immunodeficient rat.","The rat is the preferred model for toxicology studies, and it offers distinctive advantages over the mouse as a preclinical research model including larger sample size collection, lower rates of drug clearance, and relative ease of surgical manipulation. An immunodeficient rat would allow for larger tumor size development, prolonged dosing and drug efficacy studies, and preliminary toxicologic testing and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies in the same model animal. Here, we created an immunodeficient rat with a functional deletion of the Recombination Activating Gene 2 (Rag2) gene, using genetically modified spermatogonial stem cells (SSC). We targeted the Rag2 gene in rat SSCs with TALENs and transplanted these Rag2-deficient SSCs into sterile recipients. Offspring were genotyped, and a founder with a 27 bp deletion mutation was identified and bred to homozygosity to produce the Sprague-Dawley Rag2 - Rag2(tm1Hera) (SDR) knockout rat. We demonstrated that SDR rat lacks mature B and T cells. Furthermore, the SDR rat model was permissive to growth of human glioblastoma cell line subcutaneously resulting in successful growth of tumors. In addition, a human KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer cell line (H358), a patient-derived high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell line (OV81), and a patient-derived recurrent endometrial cancer cell line (OV185) were transplanted subcutaneously to test the ability of the SDR rat to accommodate human xenografts from multiple tissue types. All human cancer cell lines showed efficient tumor uptake and growth kinetics indicating that the SDR rat is a viable host for a range of xenograft studies.

2139,Mechanisms and Antitumor Activity of a Binary EGFR/DNA-Targeting Strategy Overcomes Resistance of Glioblastoma Stem Cells to Temozolomide,"Glioblastoma (GBM), a grade 4 astrocytoma, is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumors in adults  . The standard treatment of patients newly diagnosed with GBM implementing surgical tumor resection, chemoradiation using the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide  improved the median survival to 14.6 months  . Tumor recurrence is inevitable, poses major challenges for clinical management, and leads to a fatal outcome. Several mechanisms account for GBM recurrence including activity of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which repairs cytotoxic DNA lesions such as, temozolomide-induced O6-methylguanine adducts  . Chemo-and radioresistance of a small population of self-renewing, tumorigenic cancer stem cells termed tumor-initiating cells or glioma stem cells (GSC; ref. 4) prompted the need for effective molecularly targeted therapies  . The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a key oncogene driver of chemo-and radioresistance displays gene alterations in more than half of primary GBMs  . Activation of EGFR by ligand binding (e.g., EGF) triggers a cascade of cellular signaling events associated with increased cell proliferation and survival through downstream effectors including PI3-K/Akt, Ras-Raf-MAPK, and protein kinase C signaling pathways. The most common EGFR mutation, EGFRvIII (EGFR type III, de2-, D EGFR; ref.  ) results in a ligand-independent and constitutively active receptor. EGFR and EGFRvIII confer protective effects in response to DNA-damaging agents through several mechanisms including increased repair of DNA strand breaks (DSB; ref.  . Likewise, alterations of the tumor suppressor TP53 pathway in 30% of patients newly diagnosed with GBM (9) affect DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and senescence in response to various stress stimuli through transcriptional activation of multiple target genes, including p21 WAF1/CIP1 (p21; ref.  ."," Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal primary malignant brain tumor. GBM stem cells (GSC) contribute to resistance to the DNA-damaging chemotherapy, temozolomide. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) displays genomic alterations enabling DNA repair mechanisms in half of GBMs. We aimed to investigate EGFR/DNA combi-targeting in GBM.Experimental Design ZR2002 is a ""combi-molecule"" designed to inflict DNA damage through its chlorethyl moiety and induce irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition. We assessed its in vitro efficacy in temozolomide-resistant patient-derived GSCs, mesenchymal temozolomide-sensitive and resistant in vivo-derived GSC sublines, and U87/EGFR isogenic cell lines stably expressing EGFR/wild-type or variant III (EGFRvIII). We evaluated its antitumor activity in mice harboring orthotopic EGFRvIII or mesenchymal TMZ-resistant GSC tumors. ZR2002 induced submicromolar antiproliferative effects and inhibited neurosphere formation of all GSCs with marginal effects on normal human astrocytes. ZR2002 inhibited EGF-induced autophosphorylation of EGFR, downstream Erk1/2 phosphorylation, increased DNA strand breaks, and induced activation of wild-type p53; the latter was required for its cytotoxicity through p53-dependent mechanism. ZR2002 induced similar effects on U87/EGFR cell lines and its oral administration significantly increased survival in an orthotopic EGFRvIII mouse model. ZR2002 improved survival of mice harboring intracranial mesenchymal temozolomide-resistant GSC line, decreased EGFR, Erk1/2, and AKT phosphorylation and was detected in tumor brain tissue by MALDI imaging mass spectrometry. These findings provide the molecular basis of binary EGFR/DNA targeting and uncover the oral bioavailability, blood-brain barrier permeability, and antitumor activity of ZR2002 supporting potential evaluation of this first-in-class drug in recurrent GBM.",https//clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/25/24/7594.full.pdf
2182,Distribution kinetics of targeted cytotoxin in glioma by bolus or convection-enhanced delivery in a murine model,"compartment. So far, this route of IL-13 cytotoxin administration appears to be very well tolerated with no neurotoxicity.  The second clinical trial involves preresection CED of IL-13 cytotoxin followed by postresection infusion of the cytotoxin into the brain adjacent to the resection cavity.   This novel route of IL-13 cytotoxin delivery used in 27 patients has also been well tolerated. In the third clinical trial, IL-13 cytotoxin is infused directly into tumors by CED and tumor resection is performed later.  Nineteen patients have been enrolled in this clinical trial and this particular route of IL-13 administration also appears to be safe. All three clinical trials have recently completed. Currently, a randomized open-label Phase III clinical trial is ongoing at numerous centers in the US, Canada, and Europe to test the efficacy of IL-13-PE in a large patient population with recurrent GBM.","Object. Interleukin-13 receptor (IL-13R)-targeted cytotoxin (IL-13-PE38) displays a potent antitumor activity against a variety of human tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and, thus, this agent is being tested in the clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent GBM. In this study, the authors determined the safety and distribution kinetics of IL-13 cytotoxin when infused intracranially by a bolus injection and by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in an athymic nude mouse model of GBM.s. For the safety studies, athymic nude mice were given intracranial infusions of IL-13 cytotoxin into normal parenchyma by either a bolus injection or a 7-day-long CED. Toxicity was assessed by performing a histological examination of the mouse brains. For the drug distribution studies, nude mice with intracranially implanted U251 GBM tumors were given an intratumor bolus or a CED infusion of IL-13 cytotoxin. Brain tumor samples obtained between 0.25 and 72 hours after the infusion were assessed for drug distribution kinetics by performing immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses.Based on the histological changes in the tumor and brain, the maximum tolerated dose of intracranial IL-13 cytotoxin infusion in nude mice was determined to be 4 mug when delivered by a bolus injection and 10 mug when CED was used. Drug distribution reached the maximum level I hour after the bolus injection and the volume of distribution was determined to be 19.3 +/- 5.8 mm(3). Interleukin-13 cytotoxin was barely detectable 6 hours after the injection. Interestingly, when delivered by bolus injections IL-13 cytotoxin exhibited superior distribution in larger rather than smaller tumors. Convection-enhanced delivery was superior for drug distribution in the U251 tumors because when CED was used the drug remained in the tumors 6 hours after the infusion.. These studies provide confirmation of a previous hypothesis that CED of IL-13 cytotoxin is superior to bolus injections not only for the safety of the normal brain but also for maintaining drug levels for a prolonged period in infused brain tumors. These findings are highly relevant and important for the optimal clinical development of IL-13 cytotoxin or any other targeted antitumor agent for GBM therapy, in which multiple routes of delivery of an agent are being contemplated.",https//thejns.org/downloadpdf/journals/j-neurosurg/101/6/article-p1004.pdf
2210,Polyethylenimine-Spherical Nucleic Acid Nanoparticles against Gli1 Reduce the Chemoresistance and Sternness of Glioblastoma Cells,"RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics have received tremendous attention recently for their potential to revolutionize the management of diseases with a known genetic basis. In a clinical setting, RNAi offers the ability to silence the expression of genes that promote disease progression with greater potency and specificity than small molecule drugs. However, one unresolved challenge toward recognizing the clinical potential of RNAi is maximally delivering siRNA to the targeted disease site.   This is because siRNA is highly susceptible to degradation by nucleases present ubiquitously in physiological conditions, is cleared rapidly from circulation, and cannot cross cellular membranes due its large size and negative charge. As a result, there is a need to develop carriers to protect siRNA and efficiently deliver it to sites of disease. One of the greatest challenges in developing clinically translatable siRNA carriers is achieving a balance between efficacy and toxicity; many strongly cationic carriers that are highly effective for intra-cellular siRNA delivery are also toxic due to their tendencies to destabilize cellular membranes and trigger immune responses.    The reverse is also true many materials with more favorable biocompatibility profiles are less effective as transfection agents.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with nearly 100% of patients ultimately succumbing to the disease. Median patient survival is 15 months, and no standard of care currently exists for recurrent cases. Glioma stem cells (GSCs), a rare and highly aggressive subpopulation of cells within these tumors, have recently emerged as drivers of tumor initiation and recurrence, and a growing body of evidence suggests that they must be completely eradicated to prevent relapse. Toward this goal, we have developed polyethylenimine-wrapped spherical nucleic acid nanoparticles (PEI-SNAs) targeting Gli1, a transcription factor within the Hedgehog signaling pathway that is crucial for the maintenance of GSCs. Here, we demonstrate that Gli1 PEI-SNAs bind scavenger receptors on GBM cells to undergo endocytosis in a caveolae/lipid raft/dynamin-dependent manner. They further achieve similar to 30% silencing of tumor-promoting Hedgehog pathway genes and downstream target genes that promote the aggressive, chemoresistant phenotype of GBM. This produces a 30% decrease in proliferation that correlates with a robust onset of GBM cell senescence as well as an similar to 60% decrease in metabolic activity with or without cotreatment with temozolomide (TMZ), the frontline chemotherapy for GBM. Most importantly, Gli1 PEI-SNAs impair the self-renewal capacity of GBM cells as indicated by a 30-40% reduction in the expression of sternness genes and further impair the formation of stem-like neurospheres. They also substantially improve neurosphere chemosensitivity as demonstrated by a 2-fold increase in the fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis in response to low doses of TMZ. These results underscore the potential for siRNA therapeutics targeting Gli1 to reduce GBM resistance to therapy and warrant further development of PEI-SNAs and Glil-targeted therapies to alleviate drug resistance and recurrence for GBM patients.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469355/pdf/nihms-1016609.pdf

Standard treatment with radiotherapy and temozolomide provides only limited benefit and patients inevitably develop recurrent disease  . At relapse, conventional chemotherapies have not improved survival  . Although bevacizumab produces high response rates and improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in recurrent glioblastoma   , responses are rarely durable  (  and the effect on overall survival remains controversial  ."," GRN1005 is a peptide-drug conjugate with the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and tumor cells by targeting the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1. We conducted a first-in-human phase I trial of GRN1005 in patients with recurrent glioma.s Patients received GRN1005 by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Doses were escalated using a modified Fibonacci scheme. Study objectives included safety, tolerability, identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary evidence of efficacy. Tumor extracted from patients undergoing surgery following administration of GRN1005 was analyzed to determine whether therapeutic concentrations of GRN1005 were achieved. Sixty-three patients received GRN1005 at doses of 30 to 700 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Therapy was well tolerated with neutropenia, leucopenia, and fatigue as the most frequent drug-associated grade 3/4 or higher toxicities. The MTD was 650 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 mucositis and grade 4 neutropenia. There was no evidence of central nervous system toxicity or antibody production. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that exposure to GRN1005 was dose proportional. We observed one complete and two partial responses. Eight of 27 patients dosed >= 420 mg/m(2) had stable disease, which lasted a median of 51 days. Therapeutic concentrations of GRN1005 and free paclitaxel were shown in tumor tissue of surgical patients dosed with >= 200 mg/m(2).

2267,The Role of Kinase Signaling in Resistance to Bevacizumab Therapy for Glioblastoma Multiforme,"G lioblastomas multiforme (GBMs, World Health Organization grade IV gliomas) are the most common malignant primary brain tumors in adults. They are complex and heterogeneous originating from either a previous lowergrade astrocytoma (secondary GBM) or precursor cells (primary GBM).  These clinical variants possess distinct molecular profiles. Likewise, they are visibly different in prognosis and clinical outcome. Secondary GBM arises in younger people and carries a longer overall survival (OS) than primary GBM.  Currently, a standard therapeutic protocol to manage the GBMs is an intensive multimodal therapy, including maximal surgical resection, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Notwithstanding, median survival rate of GBM patients is generally very low and most of these patients usually experience tumor relapse within  year of the treatment onset.  Despite the development of advances in the treatment of other types of tumors, no cure for GBM patients has been successful to date. It denotes the challenges and difficulties in effective diagnosis and treatment of GBM. Overall, these challenges have motivated the scientists and clinicians to improve the GBM therapy aiming to maximal efficacy with minimal toxicities.  Fortunately, the advances in intraoperative imaging and surgical techniques have maximized the capability of neurosurgeons to operate the extensive tumor safely, optimize surgical utility,  and presumably enhance the patient survival rate.  Despite this, as a supplementary therapeutic approach in neuro-oncology, chemotherapy has been used for decades. At the present time, concurrent application of the oral methylator temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation followed by adjuvant TMZ therapy in the standard practice have shown pronounced clinical benefits.  Nevertheless, chemoradiotherapy has not succeeded to eradicate the GBM, and the tumor relapse eventually takes place. Hence, many efforts have been dedicated to advance in neuro-oncology. To date, antiangiogenesis therapy has been hopefully proposed to achieve a detectable therapeutic success after tumor resistance to standard therapy.  Even though antiangiogenic therapies such as bevacizumab has led to an increase in progression-free survival (PFS) but not OS, both in newly diagnosed   and in recurrent GBM, tumor relapse is manifested, finally. [] [] [] In this review, the authors preliminarily characterized a subpopulation of GBM cells in the tumor mass involved in GBM angiogenesis and resistance. Then, they pointed out the biological and therapeutic actions of bevacizumab in GBM therapy. They also described the compensatory aspects of increased kinase expression and activity within tumor cells due to bevacizumab therapy, leading to the tumor invasion in bevacizumab-resistant GBMs. Herein, it is focused on both hypoxia-dependent and -independent underlying mechanisms promoting kinase signaling-mediated tumor invasion after bevacizumab therapy. Here, the relevant possible solutions and novel molecular therapeutic targeting are provided to sensitize the GBMs to the bevacizumab, as well. Available preclinical and clinical trial studies in this context are presented.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor and is characterized by vascular hyperplasia, necrosis, and high cell proliferation. Despite current standard therapies, including surgical resection and chemoradiotherapy, GBM patients survive for only about 15 months after diagnosis. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an antiangiogenesis medication for recurrent GBM-bevacizumab-which has improved progression-free survival in GBM patients. Although bevacizumab has resulted in significant early clinical benefit, it inescapably predisposes tumor to relapse that can be represented as an infiltrative phenotype. Fundamentally, bevacizumab antagonizes the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF(A)), which is consistently released on both endothelial cells (ECs) and GBM cells. Actually, VEGF(A) inhibition on the ECs leads to the suppression of vascular progression, permeability, and the vasogenic edema. However, the consequence of the VEGF(A) pathway blockage on the GBM cells remains controversial. Nevertheless, a piece of evidence supports the relationship between bevacizumab application and compensatory activation of kinase signaling within GBM cells, leading to a tumor cell invasion known as the main mechanism of bevacizumab-induced tumor resistance. A complete understanding of kinase responses associated with tumor invasion in bevacizumab-resistant GBMs offers new therapeutic opportunities. Thus, this study aimed at presenting a brief overview of preclinical and clinical data of the tumor invasion and resistance induced by bevacizumab administration in GBMs, with a focus on the kinase responses during treatment. The novel therapeutic strategies to overcome this resistance by targeting protein kinases have also been summarized.",https//www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/cbr.2018.2651
2289,p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis sensitizes drug-resistant U251 glioblastoma stem cells to temozolomide through enhanced apoptosis,"Malignant glioma is the most common primary tumor of the brain and the most aggressive human tumor   . Despite intense efforts to find effective treatments, high-grade malignant gliomas, particularly glioblastoma (GBM), are currently incurable. Temozolomide (TMZ), a first-line chemotherapeutic agent, in addition to radiotherapy and surgical resection, improved the overall survival rate and progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM   . However, numerous GBM cases gradually develop resistance to TMZ treatment despite the initial benefit. Intrinsic or acquired chemoresistance is a major cause of TMZ treatment failure in GBM patients  . TMZ is a DNA-alkylating agent that causes DNA damage predominantly by methylating the O  -position of guanine, eventually inducing cell death () . Previous studies have suggested a significant inverse association between cellular ability to repair O-alkyl guanine and sensitivity to methylating agents     . O  -methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein, which restores the structural integrity of O  -alkylated guanine bases by direct transfer of the alkyl group to an internal cysteine residue (Cys145) within its active site   . The level of MGMT expression positively correlates with in vitro and in vivo glioma resistance to TMZ and bis-chloroethylnitrosourea  1 .","Malignant glioma is a highly aggressive brain tumor with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy has been observed to prolong overall survival rate and temozolomide (TMZ), a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioblastoma (GBM), possesses the most effective clinical activity at present, although drug resistance limits its clinical outcome. Growing evidence supports the concept that initial and recurrent GBM may derive from glioblastoma stem cells, which may be responsible for drug resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a TMZ-resistant GBM cell line, U251R, was developed and subsequently divided into two subpopulations according to the CD133 immunophenotype. No significant difference was identified in the expression of O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) between CD133(+) U251R cells and CD133(-) U251R cells, whereas the CD133(+) cell population was more resistant to TMZ-induced growth inhibition and cell death. TMZ achieves its cytotoxic effect by inducing DNA lesions and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) is an essential mediator of DNA damage-induced apoptosis independently of p53 status. Therefore, whether PUMA effectively enhances growth suppression and induces apoptosis when combined with TMZ was investigated. Consequently, it was found that adenoviruses expressing wild-type-PUMA not only lead to the apoptosis of CD133(+) U251R cells alone, but also significantly increase their sensitivity toward TMZ by elevating the Bcl-2-associated X protein/B-cell lymphoma-2 ratio without alterations in MGMT expression. Therefore, PUMA may be a suitable target for intervention to improve the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ.",https//www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2015.3255/download
2314,Therapeutic Application of Noncytotoxic Molecular Targeted Therapy in Gliomas Growth Factor Receptors and Angiogenesis Inhibitors,"Gliomas are the most frequent primary malignant brain tumors in adults. Over the last decades, their incidence has increased, particularly in the elderly   . Gliomas are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) into several subtypes according to their phenotype (oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and astrocytoma) and their grade of malignancy (from WHO grade I to WHO grade IV).","Growth factor receptors and angiogenesis play major roles in the oncogenesis of gliomas. Over the last several years, several noncytotoxic molecular targeted therapies have been developed against growth factor receptors and tumor angiogenesis. In gliomas, two main anti growth factor receptor strategies have been evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials (a) small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and (b) monoclonal antibodies that target growth factors or growth factor receptors other than vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Up to now, few glioma patients have responded to small TKIs (0%-14%) or monoclonal antibodies (three case reports) delivered as a single agent. Greater doses, combined therapies, as well as the identification of molecular biomarkers predictive of response and resistance are important in order to optimize drug delivery and improve efficacy.Antiangiogenic therapies are promising for the treatment of gliomas. Thalidomide and metronomic chemotherapy were the first antiangiogenic strategies evaluated, but they have shown only modest activity. Recent studies of bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, and irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, have demonstrated a high response rate, suggesting that targeted antiangiogenic therapies may play a significant role in the management of high-grade gliomas in the future. However, the toxicity profiles of these agents are not fully defined and the radiological evaluation of possible tumor response is challenging. Clinical evaluation of several VEGF receptor TKIs is currently ongoing; one of these inhibitors, cediranib, has already demonstrated interesting activity as a single agent.

2361,Targeting autophagy to sensitive glioma to temozolomide treatment,"Glioblastoma or glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is an aggressive astrocytic cell neoplasm and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in both pediatric and adult populations. The median survival of patients with GBM is approximately 12-15 months after the initial diagnosis. Conventional therapies for patients with newly diagnosed GBM include surgical tumor resection followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Though these therapeutic methods have increased the survival rate to 14.6 months, the survival advantages are only palliative   . In March 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved temozolomide (TMZ) concomitantly with radiotherapy for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma as well as using TMZ alone as a maintenance treatment  . To date, TMZ is the most widely used and effective first-line chemotherapeutic drug for glioblastoma patients   , although several chemotherapeutic agents can be found on the current pharmaceutical market  .","Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent, is widely used for treating primary and recurrent high-grade gliomas. However, the efficacy of TMZ is often limited by the development of resistance. Recently, studies have found that TMZ treatment could induce autophagy, which contributes to therapy resistance in glioma. To enhance the benefit of TMZ in the treatment of glioblastomas, effective combination strategies are needed to sensitize glioblastoma cells to TMZ. In this regard, as autophagy could promote cell survival or autophagic cell death, modulating autophagy using a pharmacological inhibitor, such as chloroquine, or an inducer, such as rapamycin, has received considerably more attention. To understand the effectiveness of regulating autophagy in glioblastoma treatment, this review summarizes reports on glioblastoma treatments with TMZ and autophagic modulators from in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as clinical trials.

Two-year survival ranges from 25 %-30 %   , and progression free survival (PFS) is 6-7 months   .","Glioblastoma, an incurable, malignant, and highly vascular tumor, is a seemingly ideal target for anti-angiogenic therapies such as bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody. Phase II trials in recurrent glioblastoma demonstrated bevacizumab was associated with clinical benefits, including decreases in brain edema and corticosteroids use resulting from reduced vascular permeability, as well as radiographic responses in 25 %-40 % of patients. In newly diagnosed disease, a phase III trial (AVAglio) showed adding bevacizumab to standard chemoradiotherapy improved progression free survival (PFS), with preservation of quality of life, and reduced corticosteroids use, but did not improve overall survival (OS). Another similar phase III trial (RTOG 0825) found similar PFS and OS trends, but suggested that the addition of bevacizumab resulted in more frequent cognitive decline compared with standard chemoradiotherapy. However, interpretation of those findings is limited by the fact that progressing patients were not evaluated, and patients remained longer on study in the bevacizumab arm. It is possible that the observed cognitive decline represented unrecognized tumor progression, rather than deleterious bevacizumab effects. Regardless, even if real, it is difficult to ascertain how improvements in PFS and quality of life compare with the associated economic costs and increased toxicities of bevacizumab, in the setting of no survival benefit. Further studies in recurrent disease are being conducted; preliminary results of a randomized trial showed favorable results with the combination with CCNU, and final results are awaited. Meanwhile, outside the realm of clinical trials, the current trend appears to be to reserve bevacizumab for use in recurrent disease, or for patients with moderate or severe neurologic symptoms, either in the newly diagnosed or recurrent setting. Further research efforts are needed to determine optimal candidates for this treatment from a molecular standpoint, as well as to develop imaging tools capable of accurately identifying response and progression, and to establish new drug combinations that could result in unquestionable clinical benefit and improved survival in these patients.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11864-014-0308-2.pdf

According to The Cancer Genome Atlas database, homozygous deletion of the p16INK4a gene occurs in 50% of glioblastomas  . Other common cell-cyclerelated mutations in glioblastomas include amplification and overexpression of CDK4 and homozygous deletion/mutation of RB, followed in frequency by overexpression of cyclin D1 and amplification of CDK6  . Overall, the CDK4/6-Rb-E2F axis is deregulated in approximately 80% of glioblastomas, underscoring the clinical potential of cell-cycle targeting in this patient population. Preclinical studies demonstrated that tumor cells treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors exhibited reduction of phosphorylation of RB, G 1 -phase arrest, and decreased proliferation, and moreover, the inhibition of CDK4/6 activity slowed glioma progression  ."," CDK4/6-dependent cell-cycle regulation is disrupted in most glioblastomas.

Blood, tumor, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected, and total and unbound ribociclib concentrations were determined. Pharmacodynamic effects, assessed by RB and FOXM1 phosphorylation, were compared with matched archival tissue. Patients with positive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects were enrolled into the expansion cohort for preliminary assessment of progression-free survival (PFS). Twelve patients were enrolled. The mean unbound ribociclib concentrations in CSF, nonenhancing, and enhancing tumor regions were 0.374 mmol/L, 0.560, and 2.152 mmol/kg, respectively, which were more than 5-fold the in vitro IC50 for inhibition of CDK4/6 (0.04 mmol/L). G1-to-S phase suppression was inferred by decreases in phosphorylation of RB (P < 0.01) and cellular proliferation (P < 0.05). Six of 12 patients were enrolled into the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-guided expansion cohort and demonstrated a median PFS of 9.7 weeks. Examination of recurrent tumors following monotherapy indicated upregulation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Ribociclib exhibited good CNS penetration, and target modulation was indicated by inhibition of RB phosphorylation and tumor proliferation. Ribociclib monotherapy showed limited clinical efficacy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

2487,Interleukin 4 receptor-directed cytotoxin therapy for human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in animal models,"Metastatic SCCHN  is difficult to treat by conventional means. One particularly challenging subpopulation of patients to address from a therapeutic perspective is the one with persistent regional disease after maximal surgical/radiotherapy    . Because patients with persistent regional disease after treatment are resistant to traditional forms of therapy, many biological response modifiers are under investigation both to increase the potential for cure and to provide improved palliation. One particularly exciting area of investigation is the use of tumorspecific toxins targeting local-regional disease.","Receptors for interleukin 4 (IL-4R) are overexpressed on the surface of various human solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN). On the basis of this preferential receptor overexpression, a novel IL-4R-targeted cytotoxin, IL-4 (38-37)-PE38KDEL, was developed in which circularly permuted IL-4 [IL-4 (38-37)] was fused to mutated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38KDEL). Despite the recognized expression of the IL-4R on SSCHN, the utility of a receptor-specific fusion protein for the treatment of this disease remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to establish the utility of IL-4 (38-37)-PE38KDEL for the treatment of established SSCHN in animal models of human disease.Expression of IL-4R in SCCHN was confirmed by immunohistochemistry with eight of eight tissue sections expressing IL-4R. Protein synthesis inhibition assays demonstrated growth inhibition of two cell lines in IL-4 (38-37)-PE38KDEL in a dose-dependent fashion. In two SCCHN s.c. xenografted nude mouse models, i.p. and intratumoral injection of IL-4 (38-37)-PE38KDEL mediated tumor regression with no visual toxicity observed in any of the animals. Subcultured tumor cells after intratumoral treatment with IL-4 toxin did not develop resistance to the drug. These data demonstrate that IL-4 (38-37)-PE38KDEL is effective in mediating significant antitumor effects in SCCHN and may represent an attractive therapeutic option for patients with advanced cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.",https//clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/8/1/281.full.pdf
2513,An Overview of Alternating Electric Fields Therapy (NovoTTF Therapy) for the Treatment of Malignant Glioma,"Alternating electric fields therapy is a novel anticancer treatment that disrupts tumor cell mitosis. The first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indication is for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. In this review, we will discuss the basic cell biology effects, physics properties, and clinical trial data of this emerging anticancer treatment.","As with many cancer treatments, tumor treating fields (TTFields) target rapidly dividing tumor cells. During mitosis, TTFields-exposed cells exhibit uncontrolled membrane blebbing at the onset of anaphase, resulting in aberrant mitotic exit. Based on these criteria, at least two protein complexes have been proposed as TTFields' molecular targets, including alpha/beta-tubulin and the septin 2, 6, 7 heterotrimer. After aberrant mitotic exit, cells exhibited abnormal nuclei and signs of cellular stress, including decreased cellular proliferation and p53 dependence, and exhibit the hallmarks of immunogenic cell death, suggesting that TTFields treatment may induce an antitumor immune response. Clinical trials lead to Food and Drug Administration approval for their treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Detailed modeling of TTFields within the brain suggests that the location of the tumor may affect treatment efficacy. These observations have a profound impact on the use of TTFields in the clinic, including what co-therapies may be best applied to boost its efficacy.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11910-015-0606-5.pdf
2536,Recurrent Glioblastoma From Molecular Landscape to New Treatment Perspectives,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive central nervous system (CNS) primary malignancy in adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 65 years  . Annual incidence is approximately 3 per 100,000 per year and increases with age and male sex   . The standard of care in newly diagnosed GBMM includes maximal safe surgical resection, followed by concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) and six monthly cycles of adjuvant TMZ  . Median overall survival (OS) varies between 12-18 months   and the 5-year survival in GBM is below 7%   . In adults, younger age and a good performance status (Karnofsky performance score KPS > 70 or WHO score 0) at diagnosis are favorable prognostic factors   . After first line medical management, GBM virtually always recurs with poorer prognosis (i.e., median PFS of 1.5-6 months and median OS of 2-9 months)    .","Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain cancer in adults. The prognosis remains poor following standard-of-care treatment with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with a median overall survival of about 15 months. Theoretically, all glioblastoma patients relapse. Once tumors progress after first-line therapy, treatment options are limited and management of recurrent glioblastoma remains challenging. In recent years, new treatments have been tested on recurrent glioblastoma patients. These include immunotherapy, antiangiogenic treatment, targeted therapy and combination regimens. Here, we review these treatment approaches and provide an overview on the molecular characteristics of recurrent glioblastoma.Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive form among malignant central nervous system primary tumors in adults. Standard treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma consists in maximal safe resection, if feasible, followed by radiochemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide; despite this multimodal treatment, virtually all glioblastomas relapse. Once tumors progress after first-line therapy, treatment options are limited and management of recurrent glioblastoma remains challenging. Loco-regional therapy with re-surgery or re-irradiation may be evaluated in selected cases, while traditional systemic therapy with nitrosoureas and temozolomide rechallenge showed limited efficacy. In recent years, new clinical trials using, for example, regorafenib or a combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy were performed with promising results. In particular, molecular targeted therapy could show efficacy in selected patients with specific gene mutations. Nonetheless, some molecular characteristics and genetic alterations could change during tumor progression, thus affecting the efficacy of precision medicine. We therefore reviewed the molecular and genomic landscape of recurrent glioblastoma, the strategy for clinical management and the major phase I-III clinical trials analyzing recent drugs and combination regimens in these patients.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/cancers/cancers-13-00047/article_deploy/cancers-13-00047-v2.pdf
2587,Current strategies for targeted delivery of bio-active drug molecules in the treatment of brain tumor,"Brain tumor is one of the most challenging diseases to treat and is a major fear in the western countries. About a quarter of the population is suffering from this problem  . Despite of enormous research in the area of brain targeting, patients suffering from CNS diseases such as brain tumors, HIV encephalopathy, epilepsy, cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders  . The major obstacle in the specific drug delivery to brain is blood brain barrier (BBB)  . The innumerable anatomical and physiological barriers comprising highly impermeable tight junctions of the endothelial cells, a centre of enzymes and occurrence of several receptors including transporters and efflux pumps are blameable for this limited drug approachability to brain. BBB consists close synchronization between brain endothelial cells (BEC), pericytes, astrocytes and neurovascular units, which rigorously controls the cerebral blood flow thus maintaining brain homeostasis         . The presence of tight junctions in BBB accumulated from transmembrane proteins (e.g. occludin, claudins), junctional adhesions and selective endothelial adhesion molecules   . Tight junction's diminished pinocytics activity which further restricts the passage of compounds from the blood into the extra cellular environment of the brain   . It also maintains the polarity of enzymes and receptors on luminal and abluminal membrane domains as well as confining the paracellular permeability of solutes  . The adherens junction proteins (VE-cadherin, PECAM-1) also stabilize the cell-cell interactions at the junctional zones  . Although some approaches (i.e. intracerebral or intracerebroventricular administration) are available for specific brain delivery but their effectiveness is limited due to local drug delivery (in well-defined tumors)  . Brain tumor includes gliomas (astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas), meningiomas, which are located outside the BBB, or metastases (mainly from lung, breast, melanoma, renal and colon cancers)  . The most hostile features of high grade brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme) include wide spread infiltration of surrounding tissue and high endothelial proliferation of aglomeruloid multilayer vasculature. The collective consequences of partial BBB, high intratumoral interstitial pressure, poor blood perfusion and expression of additional drug resistance mechanisms become therapeutic resistance of glioblastoma against optimum drug delivery  . Along with BBB, choroid plexus  forms a second barrier to separating the blood from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is functionally as well as morphologically different from BBB. The choroid epithelial cells acting as effective barrier against drug delivery and allowing the diffusion of small molecules  . However, these cells afford a little involvement in resistance against solute influx compared with the BBB endothelial cells  . The blood-CSF barrier does not subsidize in the penetration of drugs into the human brain due to its smaller surface area (1000-fold smaller than the surface area of the BBB)  . Mostly available anti-cancer drugs are large hydrophobic molecules which have limited permeability via BBB but they are good substrates for the MDR efflux pumps (expressed by both the BBB vasculature and the tumor cells)  . Only a limited anticancer drugs such as irinotecan (a topoisomerase I inhibitor), melphalan and temozolomide are capable of being transported across the BBB. Some first line drugs specifically nitrosoureas (carmustine and vincristine) are not capable of crossing the BBB so it was not effective for the treatment of malignant glioma. That's why concomitant radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy became standard treatment for newly diagnosed glioma and improving survival of the patients. From the above conversation, it is clear that the protective barriers confining the passage of the foreign particles into the brain are the main impediment for the brain drug delivery. Furthermore, the physiological confrontation to drug transport at the BBB is correspondingly broad and includes high electrical resistance (due to a high expression of occludin) and efflux transporters   . Coupling of organic anion and cation transporters with both the luminal and basolateral membranes also contributes to charge gradients. Hence, the major challenge in drug development and delivery for the neurological diseases is to design non-invasive nanocarrier systems that can assist controlled and targeted drug delivery to the specific regions of the brain. The formulation researchers should consider the following parameters for optimum drug transport across the BBB such as (i) compound should be unionized, (ii) log p value should be near to 2, (iii) molecular weight should be less than 400 Da and (iv) cumulative number of hydrogen bonds should not go beyond 8-10. Moreover, it should also accentuate the configuration and the molecular mechanism involved in the drug transport through BBB  2 .","Brain tumor is one of the most challenging diseases to treat.

2632,Theranostic 3-Dimensional nano brain-implant for prolonged and localized treatment of recurrent glioma,"available in the clinic for the last two decades      . Pioneering work done by Henry  lead to the development of this pelletized microparticle implant, formed by a surface-eroding polyanhydride, p-Carboxyphenoxy propane-sebacic acid (CPP-SA), which delivers oncolytic agent, Carmustine (BCNU), for nearly 7 days (90%). This provided an improved median survival advantage of ~2.3 months 31 . Although, Gliadel remains to be the model system for intracranial drug delivery, tumor recurrence has been reported in majority of treated cases, predominantly, at the site of resected primary tumor. This suggests that 7-day release may be inadequate to counter recurrence. In addition, the limited tissue penetration of Carmustine (1-5 mm) and its short half-life (20 min.) are major limiting factors for sustained therapeutic effects. Clearly, there exists an urgent necessity to improve the prolonged drug delivery for anti-glioma drugs  33 .","Localized and controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics directly in brain-tumor for prolonged periods may radically improve the prognosis of recurrent glioblastoma. Here, we report a unique method of nanofiber by fiber controlled delivery of anti-cancer drug, Temozolomide, in orthotopic brain-tumor for one month using flexible polymeric nano-implant. A library of drug loaded (20 wt%) electrospun nanofiber of PLGA-PLA-PCL blends with distinct in vivo brain-release kinetics (hours to months) were numerically selected and a single nano-implant was formed by co-electrospinning of nano-fiber such that different set of fibres releases the drug for a specific periods from days to months by fiber-by-fiber switching. Orthotopic rat glioma implanted wafers showed constant drug release (116.6 mu g/day) with negligible leakage into the peripheral blood (< 100 ng) rendering similar to 1000 fold differential drug dosage in tumor versus peripheral blood. Most importantly, implant with one month release profile resulted in long-term (>4 month) survival of 85.7% animals whereas 07 day releasing implant showed tumor recurrence in 54.6% animals, rendering a median survival of only 74 days. In effect, we show that highly controlled drug delivery is possible for prolonged periods in orthotopic brain-tumor using combinatorial nanofibre libraries of bulk-eroding polymers, thereby controlling glioma recurrence.",https//www.nature.com/articles/srep43271.pdf
2658,Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in neuro-oncology Hopes and disappointments,"High-grade gliomas are the most common primary intracranial malignancies and account for over half of all malignant brain tumors in adults. Glioblastoma is defined by WHO as grade a IV tumor, the highest grade and most lethal of all gliomas. Despite recent developments in the treatment of highgrade gliomas, only few patients are cured (1). The limited treatment options for patients with recurrent gliomas (2 -4) underscore the need for clinical investigations into new agents with novel mechanisms of action.","Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment made over the past two decades, high-grade gliomas are still incurable neoplasms. Moreover, after failing adjuvant therapy, few active treatments are available. In this setting, novel agents, such as new chemotherapy compounds and anticancer agents against specific molecular targets, have therefore been investigated. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an intriguing target in high-grade gliomas because it is frequently overexpressed due to amplification of the EGFR gene. Gefitinib and erlotinib act as ATP mimetic agents, binding to the cytoplasmic ATP pocket domain and blocking receptor phosphorylations and, thereby, EGFR-mediated activation of downstream pathways. These drugs have been evaluated in several clinical trials treating recurrent high-grade gliomas with contrasting results. Retrospective correlative analyses generated a plethora of putative predictive factors of activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The first generations of studies on EGFR inhibitors have not found significant activity of these agents in high-grade gliomas. Furthermore, no clear molecular or clinical predictors have been identified. As with other targeted agents, prospective trials using specific criteria and standardized methods to evaluate tissue biomarkers are required to find predictors of EGFR inhibitors activity in high-grade glioma patients.",https//clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/14/4/957.full.pdf
2671,Discovery of Small-Molecule Inhibitors of the HSP90-Calcineurin-NFAT Pathway against Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most common and malignant primary brain cancer in adults, accounting for approximately 50% of all gliomas and up to 15% of all brain tumors  . The prognosis for GBM patients remains poor because the tumor cells can invade the surrounding brain tissues to cause secondary lethal brain disorders  . Even treated with surgical resection combined with radio-chemotherapy immediately after diagnosis, the median survival time of GBM is less than 17 months. Several FDA-approved alkylating drugs (e.g., lomustine, carmustine and temozolomide) have been used to treat GBM  , but tend to cause chemoresistance and are largely ineffective to recurrent glioblastoma  . There remains an urgent clinical need for exploring the molecular basis of glioblastoma pathology  and discovering novel chemotherapeutic drugs  .","Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most common and malignant types of primary brain tumors in adults, with a dismal prognosis. Although alkylating agents such as temozolomide are widely applied as the first-line treatment for GBM, they often cause chemoresistance and remain ineffective with recurrent GBM. Alternative therapeutics against GBM are urgently needed in the clinic. We report herein the discovery of a class of inhibitors (YZ129 and its derivatives) of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway that exhibited potent anti-tumor activity against GBM. YZ129-induced GBM cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase promoted apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration. At the molecular level, YZ129 directly engaged HSP90 to antagonize its chaperoning effect on calcineurin to abrogate NFAT nuclear translocation, and also suppressed other proto-oncogenic pathways including hypoxia, glycolysis, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis. Our data highlight the potential for targeting the cancer-promoting HSP90 chaperone network to treat GBM.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6430684/pdf/nihms-1513135.pdf
2732,Inhibiting 4EBP1 in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma remains one of the major challenges in pediatric and adult cancer. Despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, patients survive a median of 18 months or less from diagnosis  . Glioblastomas frequently activate signaling through PI3K, AKT, and mTOR  . A number of inhibitors that target key components of this pathway are being tested clinically and, to date, have shown limited efficacy   . mTOR integrates the abundance of nutrients and growth factor to cell growth and metabolism  . Signaling functions of mTOR are distributed between at least two distinct protein complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. In mTORC1, mTOR is associated with proteins including PRAS40 and the rapamycin-sensitive adapter protein of mTOR (Raptor), whereas in mTORC2, mTOR is associated with a separate protein complex including the rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor). The mTORC1 complex signals primarily through two effectors. One is p0 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K). Phosphorylation and activation of S6K result in phosphorylation of S6K targets such as eIF4B and ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6). The second major output of mTOR signaling is via regulation of the eukaryotic initiation complex eIF4F, which recruits mRNA to the ribosome and consists of three proteins (i) eIF4A, an RNA helicase; (ii) eIF4E, a protein that binds and recruits the m  GTP cap of mRNA to the eIF4F complex; and (iii) eIF4G, which serves a scaffolding function by directly binding to eIF4E, eIF4A, and ribosome-associated eIF3  . Interaction of eIF4E with both the m  GTP cap and eIF4G is rate limiting in translation. Regulation of this step occurs through 4E-binding protein (4EBP), which binds to eIF4E at the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction interface, to prohibit its participation in the initiation complex. Hypophosphorylated 4EBP binds eIF4E with high affinity, whereas direct phosphorylation by mTOR causes 4EBP to dissociate from eIF4E. Free eIF4E can then participate in the translation initiation complex, leading to an increase in cap-dependent translation and driving proliferation.","Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive adult brain cancer. Tumors show frequent dysregulation of the PI3K-mTOR pathway. Although a number of small molecules target the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis, their preclinical and clinical efficacy has been limited. Reasons for treatment failure include poor penetration of agents into the brain and observations that blockade of PI3K or AKT minimally affects downstream mTOR activity in glioma. Clinical trials using allosteric mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and rapalogs) to treat patients with glioblastoma have also been unsuccessful or uncertain, in part, because rapamycin inefficiently blocks the mTORC1 target 4EBP1 and feeds back to activate PI3K-AKT signaling. Inhibitors of the mTOR kinase (TORKi) such as TAK-228/MLN0128 interact orthosterically with the ATP-and substrate-binding pocket of mTOR kinase, efficiently block 4EBP1 in vitro, and are currently being investigated in the clinical trials. Preclinical studies suggest that TORKi have poor residence times of mTOR kinase, and our data suggest that this poor pharmacology translates into disappointing efficacy in glioblastoma xenografts. RapaLink-1, a TORKi linked to rapamycin, represents a drug with improved pharmacology against 4EBP1. In this review, we clarify the importance of 4EBP1 as a biomarker for the efficacy of PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors in glioblastoma. We also review mechanistic data by which RapaLink-1 blocks p-4EBP1 and discuss future clinical strategies for 4EBP1 inhibition in glioblastoma.

2755,CNS Anticancer Drug Discovery and Development Conference White Paper,"The first CNS Anticancer Drug Discovery and Development Conference (ADDDC) was organized and convened in 2014 by scientists and physicians frustrated by the dearth of available and efficacious anticancer drugs for the treatment of primary infiltrative and secondary metastatic tumors of the central nervous system. The Organizing and Scientific Program Committees were tasked with designing the conference using educational lectures covering many, but not all, areas relevant to anticancer drug discovery/development. By all indications, they were successful in that goal. By nearly universal agreement, committee members and speakers felt that a White Paper, summarizing approaches and concerns voiced at the conference, should be written and made available to the academic and pharmaceutical industry communities.","Following the first CNS Anticancer Drug Discovery and Development Conference, the speakers from the first 4 sessions and organizers of the conference created this White Paper hoping to stimulate more and better CNS anticancer drug discovery and development.

Despite multimodality treatment, the prognosis is still poor. Therefore, further work is urgently required to discover novel therapeutic strategies for GBM treatment.s The synergistic effects of cotreatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat and bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 or OTX015 were validated using cell viability assays in GBM cell lines. Furthermore, the inhibitory mechanisms were investigated via an EdU proliferation assay, an apoptosis assay, qPCR, Western blot and RNAseq analyses. We found that the cotreatment with panobinostat and JQ1 or OTX015 synergistically inhibited cell viability in GBM cells. The cotreatment with panobinostat and JQ1 or OTX015 markedly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Compared with treatment with each drug alone, the cotreatment with panobinostat and JQ1 induced more profound caspase 3/7 activation and cytotoxicity. Mechanistic investigation showed that combination of panobinostat with JQ1 or OTX015 results in stronger repression of GBM-associated oncogenic genes or pathways as well as higher induction of GBM-associated tumor-suppressive genes.

2876,Human mesenchymal stromal cells as cellular drug-delivery vectors for glioblastoma therapy a good deal?,"Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common, invasive and aggressive primary brain tumor in humans. Over the last 12 years or so, most patients with GB have been treated with the Stupp protocol  , consisting of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. The efficacy of this treatment is limited, with median overall survival of no more than 15 months  . GB treatment is complicated by the high resistance of these tumors to standard chemotherapy agents, the critical role of angiogenesis in their growth and spread and the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which serves as a physiological obstacle to the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system. The development of innovative anticancer drugs targeting both tumor cells and blood vessels is therefore urgently required, together with effective systems for delivering these drugs to the brain."," Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant brain tumor in adults. It is characterized by angiogenesis and a high proliferative and invasive capacity. Standard therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide) is of limited efficacy. Innovative anticancer drugs targeting both tumor cells and angiogenesis are urgently required, together with effective systems for their delivery to the brain. We assessed the ability of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to uptake the multikinase inhibitor, sorafenib (SFN), and to carry this drug to a brain tumor following intranasal administration. MSCs were primed with SFN and drug content and release were quantified by analytical chemistry techniques. The ability of SFN-primed MSCs to inhibit the survival of the human U87MG GB cell line and endothelial cells was assessed in in vitro assays. These cells were then administered intranasally to nude mice bearing intracerebral U87MG xenografts. Their effect on tumor growth and angiogenesis was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and immunofluorescence analyses, and was compared with the intranasal administration of unprimed MSCs or SFN alone. MSCs took up about 9 pg SFN per cell, with no effect on viability, and were able to release 60% of the primed drug. The cytostatic activity of the released SFN was entirely conserved, resulting in a significant inhibition of U87MG and endothelial cell survival in vitro. Two intranasal administrations of SFN-primed MSCs in U87MG-bearing mice resulted in lower levels of tumor angiogenesis than the injection of unprimed MSCs or SFN alone, but had no effect on tumor volume. We also observed an increase in the proportion of small intratumoral vessels in animals treated with unprimed MSCs; this effect being abolished if the MSCs were primed with SFN. We show the potential of MSCs to carry SFN to brain tumors following an intranasal administration. However, the therapeutic effect is modest probably due to the pro-tumorigenic properties of MSCs, which may limit the action of the released SFN. This calls into question the suitability of MSCs for use in GB therapy and renders it necessary to find methods guaranteeing the safety of this cellular vector after drug delivery.",https//jeccr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13046-017-0605-2.pdf
2908,Pathway inhibition emerging molecular targets for treating glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary central nervous system tumor, accounting for 60% of the 7, 000 primary brain tumors diagnosed annually in the United States.  Patients who receive a diagnosis of glioblastoma have a dismal prognosis, typically dying within 3 months if untreated. Standard treatment increases median survival to  months, although disease tends to progress within 6-9 months and the -year survival rate is ,5%.  In this review, we discuss the limitations of existing therapies for glioblastoma before summarizing ongoing efforts to identify novel molecular targets and develop novel targeted agents for this disease.","Insights into the molecular pathogenesis of glioblastoma have not yet resulted in relevant clinical improvement. With standard therapy, which consists of surgical resection with concomitant temozolomide in addition to radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide, the median duration of survival is 12-14 months. Therefore, the identification of novel molecular targets and inhibitory agents has become a focus of research for glioblastoma treatment. Recent results of bevacizumab may represent a proof of principle that treatment with targeted agents can result in clinical benefits for patients with glioblastoma. This review discusses limitations in the existing therapy for glioblastoma and provides an overview of current efforts to identify molecular targets using large-scale screening of glioblastoma cell lines and tumor samples. We discuss preclinical and clinical data for several novel molecular targets, including growth factor receptors, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, SRC-family kinases, integrins, and CD95 ligand and agents that inhibit these targets, including erlotinib, enzastaurin, dasatinib, sorafenib, cilengitide, AMG102, and APG101. By combining advances in tumor screening with novel targeted therapies, it is hoped that new treatment options will emerge for this challenging tumor type.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3107100/pdf/nor039.pdf
2939,Rapalink-1 Targets Glioblastoma Stem Cells and Acts Synergistically with Tumor Treating Fields to Reduce Resistance against Temozolomide,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal disease that can occur at any age, with a worse prognosis in older patients. The disease is considered to be driven by glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), a small subpopulation of highly tumorigenic cells that have stem-like properties including self-renewal, high proliferation rates, and an ability to generate and regenerate different progenies of the tumor      . GSCs also regulate the molecular process of epithelial-like-to-mesenchymal-like transition (EMT) process, in which the cells acquire a greater motile and therapy resistant phenotype  .","Glioblastoma (GBM) resistance to standard treatment is driven by stem-like cell behavior and epithelial-like-mesenchymal transition. The main purpose of this paper was to functionally validate a novel discovered pharmacological strategy to treat GBM, the dual mTOR pathway inhibitor Rapalink-1 (RL1) using relevant stem cell models of the disease to unravel mechanistic insights. Our approach also interrogates combination studies with clinical treatment options of tumor treating fields (TTFields) and the best standard of care chemotherapy, temozolomide (TMZ). We provided clinical relevance of our experimental work through in silico evaluation on molecular data of diverse patient samples. RL1 effectively impaired motility and clonogenicity of GBM stem cells and reduced the expression of stem cell molecules. We elucidated a synergistic therapeutic potential of the inhibitor with TTFields to minimize therapy resistance toward TMZ, which supports its consideration for further translational oriented studies.Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal disease with limited clinical treatment options available. Recently, a new inhibitor targeting the prominent cancer signaling pathway mTOR was discovered (Rapalink-1), but its therapeutic potential on stem cell populations of GBM is unknown. We applied a collection of physiological relevant organoid-like stem cell models of GBM and studied the effect of RL1 exposure on various cellular features as well as on the expression of mTOR signaling targets and stem cell molecules. We also undertook combination treatments with this agent and clinical GBM treatments tumor treating fields (TTFields) and the standard-of-care drug temozolomide, TMZ. Low nanomolar (nM) RL1 treatment significantly reduced cell growth, proliferation, migration, and clonogenic potential of our stem cell models. It acted synergistically to reduce cell growth when applied in combination with TMZ and TTFields. We performed an in silico analysis from the molecular data of diverse patient samples to probe for a relationship between the expression of mTOR genes, and mesenchymal markers in different GBM cohorts. We supported the in silico results with correlative protein data retrieved from tumor specimens. Our study further validates mTOR signaling as a druggable target in GBM and supports RL1, representing a promising therapeutic target in brain oncology.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/cancers/cancers-12-03859/article_deploy/cancers-12-03859.pdf
2991,The Landscape of Novel Therapeutics and Challenges in Glioblastoma Multiforme Contemporary State and Future Directions,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive intracranial tumor; histologically considered as a malignant glioma arising from an astrocytic lineage (WHO classification astrocytoma grade IV), and it represents the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults   . Despite the low incidence rate of glioblastoma compared to other cancer types, it portends an extremely poor prognosis with a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 1 year, and a relative survival rate at 5 and 10 years Pharmaceuticals 2020, 13, 389 2 of 26 approximately (5% and 3%, respectively)   . Glioblastoma is considered a privileged tumor because of its isolation from the surrounding structures, and the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB) which impedes the passage of several immune cells and chemotherapeutics  . In addition, the heterogeneous genetic and molecular landscape of glioblastoma constitutes a challenge in the face of developing effective therapies, which is reflected by the lack of drug approval in the past decade  . The cornerstone of glioblastoma management relies on maximal surgical resection of the tumor with concurrent chemoradiation using the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) followed by adjuvant TMZ for a total of 6 months according to the landmark trial by Stupp et al.  . The other treatment modality that has shown improved OS in glioblastoma patients is the addition of tumor treating field (TTF) to the current standard of care  , which is a device worn by the patient on the scalp, and works by delivering alternating electrical fields that disrupt the microtubules in the mitotic spindle leading to tumor cell death  . However, this treatment has proved to be challenging for patients given the low compliance rates with its use and high cost  . The addition of bevacizumab which is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma-selected patients demonstrated modest improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and better quality of life, but was associated with a high rate of adverse events without an improvement in OS   [1 . As the majority of glioblastoma ultimately recur during or after treatment, it is imperative to develop therapeutic drugs that could offer clinical benefit to these patients to improve survival, and decrease disease associated morbidity and complications. This unmet need has led to extensive preclinical research to further characterize the molecular and genetic alterations that control tumor growth, as well as the interaction between the immune system and glioblastoma in order to identify candidate targets for effective drug development. This comprehensive effort in the last decade has substantially expanded our understanding of glioblastoma and has been previously reviewed in depth  1 . Nevertheless, the limited drug approval for glioblastoma relative to the novel investigational therapies that have been tested, and the modest improvement in OS achieved in the past decade demonstrate the obligation for further research in the field of neuro-oncology to develop new therapies that can improve patient outcomes as outlined in Figure 1 . Recently, there have been promising novel drugs including targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapy that have established a possible role in anti-tumor response in glioblastoma. Moreover, enhanced drug delivery across BBB and combination treatment modalities seem to hold a prospective role in the treatment of glioblastoma."," Glioblastoma multiforme is a malignant intracranial neoplasm that constitutes a therapeutic challenge because of the associated high morbidity and mortality given the lack of effective approved medication and aggressive nature of the tumor. However, there has been extensive research recently to address the reasons implicated in the resistant nature of the tumor to pharmaceutical compounds, which have resulted in several clinical trials investigating promising treatment approaches. s We reviewed literature published since 2010 from PUBMED and several annual meeting abstracts through 15 September 2020. Selected articles included those relevant to topics of glioblastoma tumor biology, original basic research, clinical trials, seminal reviews, and meta-analyses. We provide a discussion based on the collected evidence regarding the challenging factors encountered during treatment, and we highlighted the relevant trials of novel therapies including immunotherapy and targeted medication.  Selected literature revealed four main factors implicated in the low efficacy encountered with investigational treatments which included (1) blood-brain barrier; (2) immunosuppressive microenvironment; (3) genetic heterogeneity; (4) external factors related to previous systemic treatment that can modulate tumor microenvironment. Investigational therapies discussed in this review were classified as immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Immunotherapy included (1) immune checkpoint inhibitors; (2) adoptive cell transfer therapy; (3) therapeutic vaccines; (4) oncolytic virus therapy. Targeted therapy included tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other receptor inhibitors. Finally, we provide our perspective on future directions in treatment of glioblastoma.  Despite the limited success in development of effective therapeutics in glioblastoma, many treatment approaches hold potential promise including immunotherapy and novel combinational drugs. Addressing the molecular landscape and resistant immunosuppressive nature of glioblastoma are imperative in further development of effective treatments.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/pharmaceuticals/pharmaceuticals-13-00389/article_deploy/pharmaceuticals-13-00389-v2.pdf
3041,Myelin-forming cell-specific cadherin-19 is a marker for minimally infiltrative glioblastoma stem-like cells,"We used an unbiased gene expression profiling-based approach to identify novel GSC-specific plasma membrane markers. Two GSC lines were characterized using gene microarrays compared with human neural stem cells (hNSCs), normal human brain, primary GBM, and recurrent GBM tissue samples. After filtering for plasma membrane transcripts, 19 GSC transcripts with multiple probe sets were found upregulated in contrast to findings in normal controls and whole GBM tumor samples. Candidate genes were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with two additional GSC lines along with normal human astrocytes (NHAs), the U87 glioma cell line, and the serum-cultured, patient-matched GBM lines 22T and 33T. Expression of cadherin-19 (CDH19) is restricted to minimally infiltrative GSCs, with no detectable protein in other GSCs, GBM cell lines, or normal neural cell lines on immunoblotting. These findings suggest that CDH19 (a Type II atypical cadherin specific to myelinating cells during development) 31 could serve as a feasible marker for GSC identification, isolation, and drug discovery.","OBJECT Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) exhibit stem-like properties, are highly efficient at forming tumor xeno-grafts, and are resistant to many current therapies. Current molecular identifiers of GSCs are scarce and controversial. The authors describe differential cell-surface gene expression profiling to identify GSC-specific markers.METHODS Independent human GSC lines were isolated and maintained in standard neural stem cell (NSC) media and were validated for self-renewal, multipotent differentiation, and tumor initiation properties. Candidate upregulated GSC-specific plasma membrane markers were identified through differential Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Array gene expression profiling of GSCs, human NSCs (hNSCs), normal brain tissue, and primary/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme samples.  were validated by using comparative quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis of GSCs, hNSCs, normal human astrocytes, U87 glioma cell line, and patient-matched serum-cultured glioblastoma multiforme samples.RESULTS A candidate GSC-specific signature of 19 upregulated known and novel plasma membrane associated genes was identified. Preferential upregulation of these plasma membrane linked genes was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cadherin-19 (CDH19) protein expression was enhanced in minimally infiltrative GSC lines.CONCLUSIONS Gene expression profiling of GSCs has shown CDH19 to be an exciting new target for drug development and study of GBM tumorigenesis.",https//thejns.org/downloadpdf/journals/j-neurosurg/122/1/article-p69.pdf
3058,Standards of care for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma-are we there yet?,"lioblastoma is the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults (median age, 64 y) with a preponderance in men (1.3 -1.61), whites, and those of European descent (1 compared with African Americans).   The annual incidence ranges from 3 to 5 newly diagnosed cases per 100 000 population. Therapeutic advances over the last decade have led to improvements in both patients' life expectancy and quality of life. Based on data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End  program, median survival times of all patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma improved from 8.1 months in 000 -003 to 9.7 months in 005 -008, likely owing to the introduction of temozolomide (TMZ).","Newly diagnosed glioblastoma is now commonly treated with surgery, if feasible, or biopsy, followed by radiation plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma continues to be a moving target as new therapeutic principles enrich the standards of care for newly diagnosed disease. We reviewed PubMed and American Society of Clinical Oncology abstracts from January 2006 to January 2012 to identify clinical trials investigating the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma with nitrosoureas, temozolomide, bevacizumab, and/or combinations of these agents. At recurrence, a minority of patients are eligible for second surgery or reirradiation, based on appropriate patient selection. In temozolomide-pretreated patients, progression-free survival rates at 6 months of 20% -30% may be achieved either with nitrosoureas, temozolomide in various dosing regimens, or bevacizumab. Combination regimens among these agents or with other drugs have not produced evidence for superior activity but commonly produce more toxicity. More research is needed to better define patient profiles that predict benefit from the limited therapeutic options available after the current standard of care has failed.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3534423/pdf/nos273.pdf
3110,Targeting CD133 improves chemotherapeutic efficacy of recurrent pediatric pilocytic astrocytoma following prolonged chemotherapy,"Pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), frequently seen in children and young adults, are the most common pediatric central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm  . These tumors are primarily treated with surgical resection, with gross total resection curative in the majority of cases  . However, for those cases that are not surgically curable, patients receive radiation or chemotherapy  . Focal radiation with standard doses of 45 to 54Gy are effective in long-term tumor control, but cause serious side-effects, including decreased intellectual function, endocrine deficits, secondary neoplasms, hearing loss and vasculopathy. As a result, the use of radiation in young children is limited  . Chemotherapy has been used as a first-line treatment to delay or replace radiotherapy in certain situations, such as critical tumor location, or in relapsed tumors after surgery   ."," Pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) are the most common pediatric central nervous system neoplasms. In the majority of cases these tumors are benign and receive favorable prognosis following gross total surgical resection. In patients with progressive or symptomatic tumors, aggressive surgical resection is generally not feasible, thus radiation or chemotherapy are accepted initial or adjuvant interventions. Due to serious long-lasting side-effects, radiation is limited in young children; therefore, chemotherapy is widely practiced as an adjuvant treatment for these patients. However, chemotherapy can promote the emergence of multidrug resistant tumor cells that are more malignant than those of the original tumor. CD133, a putative stem cell marker in normal tissue and malignant brain tumors, enhances multidrug resistant gene 1 (MDR1) expression following chemotherapy in adult malignant glioblastomas. This study examines the relationship between CD133 and MDR1 in pediatric PAs exposed to chemotherapy, with the goal of identifying therapeutic targets that manifest as a result of chemotherapy.s Slides were obtained for 15 recurrent PAs, seven of which had received chemotherapy prior to surgical treatment for the recurrent tumor. These samples, as well as primary tumor tissue slides from the same patients were used to investigate CD133 and MDR1 expression via immunofluorescence. Archived frozen tissue samples from the same patients were used to examine CD133, MDR1 and PI3K-Akt-NF-kappa B signaling mediators, via western blot. Two drug resistant pediatric PA cell lines Res186 and Res199 were also used to evaluate the role of CD133 on cell response to cytotoxic therapy. CD133 and MDR1 were co-expressed and their expression was elevated in recurrent PAs from patients that had received chemotherapy, compared to patients that had not received chemotherapy. PI3K-Akt-NF-kappa B signaling mediator expression was also elevated in recurrent, chemotherapy-treated PA. Suppressing CD133 expression with siCD133 decreased levels of PI3K-Akt-NF-kappa B signaling mediators and MDR1, while increasing cell chemosensitivity, as indicated by quantification of apoptotic cells following chemotherapy. CD133 contributes to multidrug resistance by regulating MDR1 levels via the PI3K-Akt-NF-kappa B signal pathway not only in adult glioblastomas, but also in pediatric PAs. Targeting CD133, adjuvant to conventional chemotherapy may improve outcomes for children with recurrent PA.",https//molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12943-017-0593-z.pdf
3136,Bevacizumab-Induced Hypertension Is a Predictive Marker for Improved Outcomes in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Treated With Bevacizumab,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant primary brain tumor that presents mainly in adults and carries a poor prognosis, with a median survival of slightly > year after surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ).  Similarly, patients with recurrent disease have been described to have median survivals in the range of  to 9 months with a variety of salvage therapies administered.   Given these poor outcomes, improved treatment strategies are clearly needed.","BACKGROUNDBevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor and is approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Previous authors have reported differential response to bevacizumab on an individual basis. Bevacizumab-induced hypertension is a well-documented side effect, and some reports have suggested this occurrence to be related to treatment outcome in other cancers. In the current study, the authors analyzed patients with recurrent GBM who were treated with bevacizumab based on whether the patients developed drug-induced hypertension.METHODSAll patients with GBM treated within the Emory Healthcare system from 2007 through 2012 were reviewed. A total of 82 patients were identified who received bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent GBM and were included in the current study. Patients were classified as normotensive or hypertensive depending on whether hypertension developed that was attributable to therapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were graphed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards method.RESULTSThe median follow-up was 19.7 months. Of the 82 patients with recurrent GBM who were treated with bevacizumab, 30 developed drug-induced hypertension. The median time to the development of hypertension was 21 days. The median PFS for the normotensive and hypertensive groups were 2.5 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.6-3.0 months) and 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.6-10.0 months), respectively (P<.001). The median OS times for the normotensive and hypertensive groups were 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.4-6.8 months) and 11.7 months (95% CI, 9.0-20.5 months), respectively (P<.001).CONCLUSIONSPatients with recurrent GBM who developed bevacizumab-induced hypertension demonstrated significantly better PFS and OS compared with normotensive individuals.

3154,Convection-Enhanced Drug Delivery to the Brain Therapeutic Potential and Neuropathological Considerations,"Convection-enhanced drug delivery (CED) describes the direct infusion of drugs into the brain parenchyma through microcatheters  . By using highly controlled flow rates to establish a pressure gradient at the tip of the infusion catheter, this technique allows drugs that do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to be delivered in therapeutic concentrations throughout large volumes of brain tissue, while minimizing systemic exposure. CED also has application for the delivery of drugs that cause intolerable or unwanted side effects when administered systemically at concentrations required to cross the BBB.","Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) describes a direct method of drug delivery to the brain through intraparenchymal microcatheters. By establishing a pressure gradient at the tip of the infusion catheter in order to exploit bulk flow through the interstitial spaces of the brain, CED offers a number of advantages over conventional drug delivery methodsbypass of the blood-brain barrier, targeted distribution through large brain volumes and minimization of systemic side effects. Despite showing early promise, CED is yet to fulfill its potential as a mainstream strategy for the treatment of neurological disease. Substantial research effort has been dedicated to optimize the technology for CED and identify the parameters, which govern successful drug distribution. It seems likely that successful clinical translation of CED will depend on suitable catheter technology being used in combination with drugs with optimal physicochemical characteristics, and on neuropathological analysis in appropriate preclinical models. In this review, we consider the factors most likely to influence the success or failure of CED, and review its application to the treatment of high-grade glioma, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).",https//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/bpa.12082?download=true

No csc therapy has been approved by the Us Food and Drug Administration. Because cscs and normal stem cells share many characteristics, csc-directed therapies have potential detrimental effects on normal stem cells, tissue maintenance, and development. Designing treatments that specifically target neural cscs while allowing neural tissue stem cells to normally develop the brain is a major challenge in pediatric neuro-oncology. In recent years, better identification and characterization of neural cscs, together with identifying differences between cscs and normal neural stem cells, have been key factors in developing tailored therapeutics for these devastating diseases.

3251,Augmented HR Repair Mediates Acquired Temozolomide Resistance in Glioblastoma,"Glioblastomas are incurable, malignant brain tumors  . The median survival of patients with glioblastomas is only slightly above a year, and 5-year survival rate is less than 10% despite aggressive treatment regimens  . The current mainstay of treatment is surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy combined with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy. Addition of temozolomide to the standard therapy increases the survival rates significantly albeit minimally   . This lack of response to temozolomide therapy is mostly due to intrinsic and acquired resistance of tumors to the drug          . With very limited alternative chemotherapeutic agents for glioblastomas (1 , temozolomide-resistant patients are virtually left without treatment options after tumor recurrence. Therefore, it is crucial to understand mechanisms of resistance to develop strategies to resensitize these tumors to temozolomide.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults and is universally fatal. The DNA alkylating agent temozolomide is part of the standard-of-care for GBM. However, these tumors eventually develop therapy-driven resistance and inevitably recur. While loss of mismatch repair (MMR) and re-expression of MGMT have been shown to underlie chemoresistance in a fraction of GBMs, resistance mechanisms operating in the remaining GBMs are not well understood. To better understand the molecular basis for therapy-driven temozolomide resistance, mice bearing orthotopic GBM xenografts were subjected to protracted temozolomide treatment, and cell lines were generated from the primary (untreated) and recurrent (temozolomide-treated) tumors. As expected, the cells derived from primary tumors were sensitive to temozolomide, whereas the cells from the recurrent tumors were significantly resistant to the drug. Importantly, the acquired resistance to temozolomide in the recurrent lines was not driven by re-expression of MGMT or loss of MMR but was due to accelerated repair of temozolomide-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Temozolomide induces DNA replication-associated DSBs that are primarily repaired by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Augmented HR appears to underpin temozolomide resistance in the recurrent lines, as these cells were cross-resistant to other agents that induced replication-associated DSBs, exhibited faster resolution of damage-induced Rad51 foci, and displayed higher levels of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE). Furthermore, in light of recent studies demonstrating that CDK1 and CDK2 promote HR, it was found that CDK1/2 inhibitors countered the heightened HR in recurrent tumors and sensitized these therapy-resistant tumor cells to temozolomide.Implications Augmented HR repair is a novel mechanism underlying acquired temozolomide resistance in GBM, and this raises the possibility of improving the therapeutic response to temozolomide by targeting HR with small-molecule inhibitors of CDK1/2.

Biologically, GBM is characterized by its high proliferative and invasive activity  . Only a few drugs were prescribed for GBM temozolomide (TMZ)  , biodegradable carmustine (BCNU) wafer   , and bevacizumab   . Till date, no effective therapeutic for GBM has emerged despite the development of a variety of molecular-targeted agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors  ."," Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 beta has emerged as an appealing therapeutic target for glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we investigated the therapeutic effect of the current approved drugs against GBM via inhibition of GSK3 beta activity both, in experimental setting and in a clinical study for recurrent GBM patients by repositioning existent drugs in combination with temozolomide (TMZ).Materials and s Progression-free and overall survival rates were compared between patients with low or high expression of active GSK3 beta in the primary tumor. GBM cells and a mouse model were examined for the effects of GSK3 beta-inhibitory drugs, cimetidine, lithium, olanzapine, and valproate. The safety and efficacy of the cocktail of these drugs (CLOVA cocktail) in combination with TMZ were tested in the mouse model and in a clinical study for recurrent GBM patients. Activation of GSK3 beta in the tumor inversely correlated with patient survival as an independent prognostic factor. CLOVA cocktail significantly inhibited cell invasion and proliferation. The patients treated with CLOVA cocktail in combination with TMZ showed increased survival compared to the control group treated with TMZ alone.

3313,Phospholipase D1 is upregulated by vorinostat and confers resistance to vorinostat in glioblastoma,". Various HDAC inhibitors such as vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA) and valproic acid are currently being tested in clinical trials on GBM     . Although the use of HDAC inhibitor as monotherapy in the clinic has been validated in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, they are less effective against solid tumors   . However, the mechanism of HDAC inhibitor resistance in solid tumors is not well-elucidated and a better understanding will improve their clinical efficacy  . Accordingly, elucidation of resistance markers and its molecular mechanisms can lead to strategies to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of HDAC inhibitor by combining agents that target factor(s) associated with resistance. Phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolyzes phospholipid to generate phosphatidic acid, a lipid second messenger, and two isoforms of phosphatidylcholinespecific PLD, PLD1 and PLD2 have been identified  . PLD is upregulated in various cancers and implicated in tumor malignancy, maintenance of self-renewal of cancer stem cells, and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy      . PLD is known to increase the invasive migration and proliferation of GBM    . However, it is unknown whether PLD confers chemoresistance to GBM. In the present study, our goal was to investigate the effect of PLD1 on resistance to vorinostat in GBM and how vorinostat is responsible for the upregulation of PLD1.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor and drug resistance remains a major barrier for therapeutics. Epigenetic alterations are implicated in GBM pathogenesis, and epigenetic modulators including histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are exploited as promising anticancer therapies. Here, we demonstrate that phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is a transcriptional target of HDAC inhibitors and confers resistance to HDAC inhibitor in GBM. Treatment of vorinostat upregulates PLD1 through PKC zeta-Sp1 axis. Vorinostat induces dynamic changes in the chromatin structure and transcriptional machinery associated withPLD1promoter region. Cotreatment of vorinostat with PLD1 inhibitor further attenuates invasion, angiogenesis, colony-forming capacity, and self-renewal capacity, compared with those of either treatment. PLD1 inhibitor overcomes resistance to vorinostat in GBM cells intracranial GBM tumors. Our finding provides new insight into the role of PLD1 as a target of resistance to vorinostat, and PLD1 inhibitor might provide the basis for therapeutic combinations with improved efficacy of HDAC inhibitor.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7692931/pdf/JCP-236-549.pdf
3345,Mechanistic interrogation of combination bevacizumab/dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor response in glioblastoma implementing novel MR and PET imaging biomarkers,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult brain tumour. Treatment remains a challenge with median overall survival just 14.6 months  . GBM tumours are highly vascularized, ostensibly representing an attractive target for antiangiogenic therapies. Clinical trials with bevacizumab (BEV), a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in recurrent GBM, have shown benefit with response rates of 28 -35 % and 6-month progressionfree survival rates of 29 -43 %  . Nevertheless, BEV does not improve overall survival, nor does it improve survival when delivered in conjunction with the Stupp protocol  . Tumour relapse occurs in the majority of patients, and is characterized by local and distant infiltration  . Moreover, in a limited number of studies BEV has been shown to enhance GBM invasion  , which may be facilitated by upregulation of several pathways. Most recently, the MET pathway has been implicated  . A role for BEV-enhanced invasion via PI3K AKT signalling has also been suggested  ."," Resistance to bevacizumab (BEV) in glioblastoma is believed to occur via activation of molecular networks including the mTOR/PI3K pathway. Using an MR/PET molecular imaging biomarker approach, we investigated the response to combining BEV with the mTOR/PI3K inhibitor BEZ235.s Tumours were established by orthotopically implanting U87MG-luc2 cells in mice. Animals were treated with BEZ235 and/or BEV, and imaged using diffusion-weighted-MRI, T2-weighted and T2*-weighted before and after administration of superparamagnetic iron oxide contrast agent. Maps for changes in relaxation rates (Delta R2, Delta R2* and apparent diffusion coefficient) were calculated. Vessel size index and microvessel density index were derived. 3'-Deoxy-3'-[F-18]fluorothymidine ([F-18] FLT) PET and O-(2-[F-18] fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([F-18] FET) PET were further performed and tumour endothelium/proliferation markers assessed by immunohistochemistry. Treatment with BEV resulted in a pronounced decrease in tumour volume (T2-weighted MRI). No additive effect on tumour volume was observed with the BEV/BEZ235 combination compared with BEV monotherapy. The Ki67 proliferation index and [F-18] FLT uptake studies were used to support the observations. Using Delta R2* and Delta R2 values, respectively, the BEV/BEZ235 combination significantly reduced tumour microvessel volume in comparison to BEV alone. Decreased microvessel density index was further observed in animals treated with the combination, supported by von Willebrand factor ( vWF) immunohistochemistry. [F-18] FET uptake was decreased following treatment with BEV alone, but was not further reduced following treatment with the combination. vWF immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the mean tumour vessel size was increased in all cohorts. Assessing MR imaging biomarker parameters together with [F-18] FETand [F-18] FLT PET provided information on mechanism of action of the drug combination and clues as to potential clinical responses. Following translation to clinical use, treatment with a BEV/BEZ235 combination could reduce peritumoral oedema obviating the requirement for steroids. The use of hypothesis-driven molecular imaging studies facilitates the preclinical evaluation of drug response.

3382,"Bevacizumab for glioblastoma current indications, surgical implications, and future directions",of bevacizumab monotherapy and combination therapy in glioblastoma to date. References of systematic reviews were assessed for additional key information including ongoing bevacizumab trials and unpublished preliminary studies presented at recent conferences around the world. The inclusion criteria used for this review were prospective Phase I-III trials using bevacizumab as therapy at the time of diagnosis or at recurrence in patients with glioblastoma. Trials examining the use of bevacizumab in unresectable tumors were also included. Articles excluded from this study were case series and articles written in languages other than English. A total of 90 articles were included in this review.,"Initial enthusiasm after promising Phase II trials for treating recurrent glioblastomas with the antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab-a neutralizing antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor-was tempered by recent Phase III trials showing no efficacy for treating newly diagnosed glioblastomas. As a result, there is uncertainty about the appropriate indications for the use of bevacizumab in glioblastoma treatment. There are also concerns about the effects of bevacizumab on wound healing that neurosurgeons must be aware of. In addition, biochemical evidence suggests a percentage of tumors treated with bevacizumab for an extended period of time will undergo transformation into a more biologically aggressive and invasive phenotype with a particularly poor prognosis. Despite these concerns, there remain numerous examples of radiological and clinical improvement after bevacizumab treatment, particularly in patients with recurrent glioblastoma with limited therapeutic options. In this paper, the authors review clinical results with bevacizumab for glioblastoma treatment to date, ongoing trials designed to address unanswered questions, current clinical indications based on existing data, neurosurgical implications of bevacizumab use in patients with glioblastoma, the current scientific understanding of the tumor response to short-and long-term bevacizumab treatment, and future studies that will need to be undertaken to enable this treatment to fulfill its therapeutic promise for glioblastoma.",https//thejns.org/downloadpdf/journals/neurosurg-focus/37/6/article-pE9.pdf
3405,Patient-derived organoids and orthotopic xenografts of primary and recurrent gliomas represent relevant patient avatars for precision oncology,"Candidate therapeutics for personalized treatment in rare tumors are difficult to test in clinical trials because of intertumor differences and the limited number of patients representing specific genetic profiles. Adult diffuse gliomas are a particularly heterogeneous group of rare brain tumors, with grade IV glioblastoma (GBM) being the most malignant subtype  . Despite surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, Anna Golebiewska, Ann-Christin Hau, Anaïs Oudin equal contribution.","Patient-based cancer models are essential tools for studying tumor biology and for the assessment of drug responses in a translational context. We report the establishment a large cohort of unique organoids and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) of various glioma subtypes, including gliomas with mutations inIDH1, and paired longitudinal PDOX from primary and recurrent tumors of the same patient. We show that glioma PDOXs enable long-term propagation of patient tumors and represent clinically relevant patient avatars that retain histopathological, genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features of parental tumors. We find no evidence of mouse-specific clonal evolution in glioma PDOXs. Our cohort captures individual molecular genotypes for precision medicine including mutations inIDH1,ATRX,TP53,MDM2/4, amplification ofEGFR,PDGFRA,MET,CDK4/6,MDM2/4, and deletion ofCDKN2A/B,PTCH, andPTEN. Matched longitudinal PDOX recapitulate the limited genetic evolution of gliomas observed in patients following treatment. At the histological level, we observe increased vascularization in the rat host as compared to mice. PDOX-derived standardized glioma organoids are amenable to high-throughput drug screens that can be validated in mice. We show clinically relevant responses to temozolomide (TMZ) and to targeted treatments, such as EGFR and CDK4/6 inhibitors in (epi)genetically defined subgroups, according toMGMTpromoter andEGFR/CDKstatus, respectively. Dianhydrogalactitol (VAL-083), a promising bifunctional alkylating agent in the current clinical trial, displayed high therapeutic efficacy, and was able to overcome TMZ resistance in glioblastoma. Our work underscores the clinical relevance of glioma organoids and PDOX models for translational research and personalized treatment studies and represents a unique publicly available resource for precision oncology.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7666297/pdf/401_2020_Article_2226.pdf
3466,Iron Labeling and Pre-Clinical MRI Visualization of Therapeutic Human Neural Stem Cells in a Murine Glioma Model,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, with a mean survival of less than one year following diagnosis, despite advances in surgical, radiation and chemotherapeutic approaches    . The diffuse, highly invasive nature of glioma cells contributes to tumor recurrence, treatment failure, and lethality. New treatment modalities, including immunotherapy, gene therapy and drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier  , have yet to achieve significant clinical success due to shortcomings in effectively targeting these invasive tumor cells, while minimizing toxicity to normal tissue  . New tumor-selective, targeted strategies are needed to achieve a significant impact on long-term survival of GBM patients."," Treatment strategies for the highly invasive brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme, require that cells which have invaded into the surrounding brain be specifically targeted. The inherent tumor-tropism of neural stem cells (NSCs) to primary and invasive tumor foci can be exploited to deliver therapeutics to invasive brain tumor cells in humans. Use of the strategy of converting prodrug to drug via therapeutic transgenes delivered by immortalized therapeutic NSC lines have shown efficacy in animal models. Thus therapeutic NSCs are being proposed for use in human brain tumor clinical trials. In the context of NSC-based therapies, MRI can be used both to non-invasively follow dynamic spatio-temporal patterns of the NSC tumor targeting allowing for the optimization of treatment strategies and to assess efficacy of the therapy. Iron-labeling of cells allows their presence to be visualized and tracked by MRI. Thus we aimed to iron-label therapeutic NSCs without affecting their cellular physiology using a method likely to gain United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval.ology For human use, the characteristics of therapeutic Neural Stem Cells must be clearly defined with any pertubation to the cell including iron labeling requiring reanalysis of cellular physiology. Here, we studied the effect of iron-loading of the therapeutic NSCs, with ferumoxide-protamine sulfate complex (FE-Pro) on viability, proliferation, migratory properties and transgene expression, when compared to non-labeled cells. FE-Pro labeled NSCs were imaged by MRI at tumor sites, after intracranial administration into the hemisphere contralateral to the tumor, in an orthotopic human glioma xenograft mouse model. FE-Pro labeled NSCs retain their proliferative status, tumor tropism, and maintain stem cell character, while allowing in vivo cellular MRI tracking at 7 Tesla, to monitor their real-time migration and distribution at brain tumor sites. Of significance, this work directly supports the use of FE-Pro-labeled NSCs for real-time tracking in the clinical trial under development ""A Pilot Feasibility Study of Oral 5-Fluorocytosine and Genetically modified Neural Stem Cells Expressing Escherichia coli Cytosine Deaminase for Treatment of Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas''.",https//storage.googleapis.com/plos-corpus-prod/10.1371/journal.pone.0007218/1/pone.0007218.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=wombat-sa%40plos-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20210302%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20210302T023523Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=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
3499,An apparent clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between bevacizumab and the anti-placental growth factor monoclonal antibody RO5323441 via a target-trapping mechanism,"Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel growth and plays a pivotal role in several physiological processes including development, reproduction and wound repair  . However, problems with angiogenic regulation are an integral hallmark of cancer, and neoplastic growths can only expand through the induction of angiogenesis   . The angiogenic pathway is, therefore, a promising target for drug development, and several therapeutics have been investigated for the treatment of cancer and other angiogenic-dependent diseases.","RO5323441 is a humanized anti-placental growth factor (PlGF) monoclonal antibody that has shown preclinical activity in several cancer models. The objective of this analysis is to examine the pharmacokinetic (PK) results from four Phase I studies that have been conducted with RO5323441 (n = 61) and to report an apparent drug-drug interaction observed when RO5323441 was administered in combination with bevacizumab.The four Phase I studies were a multiple-ascending dose study in 23 patients with solid tumors (Study 1), an open-label study in seven patients with colorectal/ovarian cancer (Study 2), a sorafenib combination study in nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (Study 3), and a bevacizumab combination study in 22 patients with recurrent glioblastoma (Study 4). A two-compartment linear population PK model was developed from these four studies to characterize the PK of RO5323441 in patients with cancer.The PK properties of RO5323441 were similar in the first three studies. However, substantially higher RO5323441 exposures were observed in Study 4 when RO5323441 was administered in combination with bevacizumab. A linear two-compartmental population PK model indicated that the co-administration of bevacizumab would decrease the clearance of RO5323441 by 53%. Clinical data suggested that the decrease in RO5323441 clearance was inversely associated with bevacizumab exposure.The exact reason for the increase in RO5323441 exposure following bevacizumab co-administration is not currently known. One possibility is a drug-drug interaction via a target-trapping mechanism that is mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1).",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00280-017-3242-8.pdf
3540,Intracerebral infusion of an EGFR-targeted toxin in recurrent malignant brain tumors,"that can be conjugated to specific ligands and delivered regionally to target tumors more specifically.     These targeted toxins have produced dramatic clinical responses in therapeutically refractory patients with leukemia    and lymphoma.  11 The efficacy of these agents is likely related to their potency, specificity, immunity to resistance mechanisms, and lack of dependence on cell-cycle kinetics.  in solid tumors, however, have been less encouraging, possibly because these large molecules have difficulty penetrating solid tumors.     The surface expression of targeted antigens may also be lower and the heterogeneity of antigen expression may be greater in solid neoplasms; as a result, a single antibody is less likely to target all neoplastic cells.","The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and intracerebral distribution of a recombinant toxin (TP-38) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor in patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors using the intracerebral infusion technique of convection-enhanced delivery (CED). Twenty patients were enrolled and stratified for dose escalation by the presence of residual tumor from 25 to 100 ng/ml in a 40-ml infusion volume. In the last eight patients, coinfusion of I-123-albumin was performed to monitor distribution within the brain. The MTD was not reached in this study. Dose escalation was stopped at 100 ng/ml due to inconsistent drug delivery as evidenced by imaging the coinfused I-123-albumin. Two DLTs were seen, and both were neurologic. Median survival after TP-38 was 28 weeks (95% confidence interval, 26.5-102.8). Of 15 patients treated with residual disease, two (13.3%) demonstrated radiographic responses, including one patient with glioblastoma multiforme who had a nearly complete response and remains alive >260 weeks after therapy. Coinfusion of I-123-albumin demonstrated that high concentrations of the infusate could be delivered >4 cm from the catheter tip. However, only 3 of 16 (19%) catheters produced intraparenchymal infusate distribution, while the majority leaked infusate into the cerebrospinal fluid spaces. Intracerebral CED of TP-38 was well tolerated and produced some durable radiographic responses at doses <= 100 ng/ml. CED has significant potential for enhancing delivery of therapeutic macromolecules throughout the human brain. However, the potential efficacy of drugs delivered by this technique may be severely constrained by ineffective infusion in many patients.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563054/pdf/neu-10-3-320.pdf
3562,Remodeling the Vascular Microenvironment of Glioblastoma with alpha-Particles,"Tumors escape antiangiogenic therapy by activation of proangiogenic signaling pathways. Bevacizumab is approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, but patients inevitably develop resistance to this angiogenic inhibitor. We previously investigated targeted α-particle therapy with 225 Ac-E4G10 as an antivascular approach and showed increased survival and tumor control in a highgrade transgenic orthotopic glioblastoma model. Here, we investigated changes in tumor vascular morphology and functionality caused by 225 Ac-E4G10. s We investigated remodeling of the tumor microenvironment in transgenic Ntva glioblastoma mice using a therapeutic 7.4-kBq dose of 225 Ac-E4G10. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses imaged morphologic changes in the tumor blood-brain barrier microenvironment. Multicolor flow cytometry quantified the endothelial progenitor cell population in the bone marrow. Diffusion-weighted MR imaged functional changes in the tumor vascular network.  The mechanism of drug action is a combination of remodeling of the glioblastoma vascular microenvironment, relief of edema, and depletion of regulatory T and endothelial progenitor cells. The primary remodeling event is the reduction of both endothelial and perivascular cell populations. Tumor-associated edema and necrosis were lessened, resulting in increased perfusion and reduced diffusion. Pharmacologic uptake of dasatinib into tumor was enhanced after α-particle therapy.  Targeted antivascular α-particle radiation remodels the glioblastoma vascular microenvironment via a multimodal mechanism of action and provides insight into the vascular architecture of platelet-derived growth factor-driven glioblastoma.","Tumors escape antiangiogenic therapy by activation of proangiogenic signaling pathways.

3605,Recombinant expressing angiopep-2 fused anti-VEGF single chain Fab (scFab) could cross blood-brain barrier and target glioma,"Glioma is the most common form of primary and malignant brain tumor and is highly aggressive. The global incidence rate for glioblastoma (GBM) is 3.2 per 100,000 people. Only 9.8% of the patients survive in the first 5 years post diagnosis and the median survival time is less than 2 years with approximately 100% relapse rate, even after receiving good treatment   . Surgery alone has limited efficacy for the treatment of aggressive GBM. Currently, postsurgery therapy combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the standard treatment method for newly diagnosed patients with GBM. However, therapeutic drugs are extremely limited due to the intrinsic resistance or multidrug resistance of the malignant glioma cells to chemotherapy drugs  . Recently, antibodies have gained prominence for treatment and several antibody-based drugs have been applied for cancer therapy.","In 2009, the FDA approved bevacizumab for the treatment of adult patients diagnosed with recurrent glioblastoma. However, the poor permeability of the macromolecules across the blood-brain barrier, determined by multifactorial anatomical and physiological milieu, restricts the clinical therapeutic effect of bevacizumab. The low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) is highly expressed in the endothelial cells of the brain capillary and the glioma cells. Angiopep-2 (ANG) is a 19-aa oligopeptide that can bind to LRP1 and penetrate the blood-brain barrier by receptor-mediated transport. Therefore, ANG can be used as a dual-targeting drug delivery carrier into the brain and the glioma sites. In this study, ANG gene was fused with the C-terminal domain of single-chain antigen binding fragment (scFab) of the anti-VEGF antibody and recombinant scFab-ANG protein was expressed and purified using Rosatte (DE3) strain. We confirmed that ANG could carry anti-VEGF-scFab, penetrate a three-dimensional model of the brain tumor, and cross the hCMEC/D3 monolayer in the in vitro blood-brain barrier model. The animal experiments demonstrated that 3 h after the tail intravenous protein injection, the fluorescent signals in the brains of the mice in the scFab-ANG group were stronger than that in the scFab group. Furthermore, the study of the in situ rat glioma model shows that scFab-ANG could target glioma while anti-VEGF-scFab could not. These findings indicate that scFab-ANG had stronger transepithelial permeability and glioma targeting capacity. Thus, it can be a potential candidate drug for glioblastoma therapy.",https//amb-express.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13568-019-0869-3.pdf
3634,Boron delivery agents for neutron capture therapy of cancer,"Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the nuclear capture and fission reactions that occur when the stable isotope boron- (  B) is irradiated with either low-energy (0.025 eV) thermal neutrons or, for clinical studies, epithermal neutrons (,000 eV), which become thermalized as they penetrate tissue. This results in the production of high-linear energy transfer (LET) alpha (α) particles ( 4 He) and recoiling lithium- (  Li) nuclei (Fig. 1a) . In order to be successful, ~ 20 μg/g of  B per weight of tumor must be selectively delivered to the tumor cells (~ 9 atoms/cell), and enough neutrons must be absorbed by them to sustain a lethal  B(n, α)  Li capture reaction  . Since α particles have very short pathlengths (5-9 μm) their destructive effects are limited to boron-containing cells (Fig. 1b) . In theory, α particles can selectively destroy tumor cells and spare adjacent normal cells. Clinical interest in BNCT has focused primarily on high grade gliomas     , patients with recurrent tumors of the head and neck region  []   []    who have failed conventional therapy, and a much smaller number of patients with cutaneous     or extra-cutaneous  melanomas. Because BNCT primarily is a biologically, rather than a physically, targeted type of particle radiation therapy, it should be possible to selectively destroy tumor cells infiltrating normal tissue. The requirement, however, is that sufficient amounts of  B and thermal neutrons are delivered to the site of the tumor. Up until 2014, the source of these neutrons has been specially designed nuclear reactors, but recently a number of companies in Japan  and the United States  have fabricated acceleratorbased neutron sources, several of which are either being or will be evaluated in Phase I/II clinical trials.","Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a binary radiotherapeutic modality based on the nuclear capture and fission reactions that occur when the stable isotope, boron-10, is irradiated with neutrons to produce high energy alpha particles. This review will focus on tumor-targeting boron delivery agents that are an essential component of this binary system. Two low molecular weight boron-containing drugs currently are being used clinically, boronophenylalanine (BPA) and sodium borocaptate (BSH). Although they are far from being ideal, their therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with high grade gliomas, recurrent tumors of the head and neck region, and a much smaller number with cutaneous and extra-cutaneous melanomas. Because of their limitations, great effort has been expended over the past 40 years to develop new boron delivery agents that have more favorable biodistribution and uptake for clinical use. These include boron-containing porphyrins, amino acids, polyamines, nucleosides, peptides, monoclonal antibodies, liposomes, nanoparticles of various types, boron cluster compounds and co-polymers. Currently, however, none of these have reached the stage where there is enough convincing data to warrant clinical biodistribution studies. Therefore, at present the best way to further improve the clinical efficacy of BNCT would be to optimize the dosing paradigms and delivery of BPA and BSH, either alone or in combination, with the hope that future research will identify new and better boron delivery agents for clinical use.",https//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1186/s40880-018-0299-7?download=true
3660,PiggyBac mutagenesis and exome sequencing identify genetic driver landscapes and potential therapeutic targets of EGFR-mutant gliomas,"Gliomas constitute 30% of all brain tumors. Their high-grade form, glioblastoma (GBM), accounts for 80% of malignant brain tumors and is one of the most lethal cancers, with median survival of 12.2 to 18.2 months    . Spinal gliomas (astrocytomas) form 60% of all spinal tumors in children and adolescents, with higher-grade lesions having a mean survival of 15.5 months. Surgical resection of spinal gliomas is challenging due to their infiltration of the spinal cord, presenting a barrier to molecular studies, and there is a lack of animal models."," Glioma is the most common intrinsic brain tumor and also occurs in the spinal cord. ActivatingEGFRmutations are common inIDH1wild-type gliomas. However, the cooperative partners ofEGFRdriving gliomagenesis remain poorly understood. We exploreEGFR-mutant glioma evolution in conditional mutant mice by whole-exome sequencing, transposon mutagenesis forward genetic screening, and transcriptomics. We show mutantEGFRis sufficient to initiate gliomagenesis in vivo, both in the brain and spinal cord.

3738,Inhibition of Polo-Like Kinase 1 Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Sensitizes Glioblastoma Cells to Ionizing Radiation,"G lioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and common glial tumors, and it represents the main type of primary cancer of the central nervous system in adults. It is associated with high mortality, a median overall survival rate of 2.5 months in most cases, and a 2-year overall survival of 5.4%,  being one of the hardest central nervous system tumors to be treated. The actual standard treatment for GBM combines tumor resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.","Despite efforts to improve surgical, radiologic, and chemotherapeutic strategies, the outcome of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) is still poor. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays key roles in cell cycle control and has been associated with tumor growth and prognosis. Here, we aimed at testing the radio-sensitizing effects of the PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 on eight GBM cell lines. For cell cycle analysis, T98G, U251, U343 MG-a, LN319, SF188, U138 MG, and U87 MG cell lines were treated with 10, 50, or 100 nM of BI 2536 for 24 hours. In addition, cell cultures exposed to BI 2536 50 nM for 24 hours were irradiated with c-rays from 60 Cobalt source at final doses of 2, 4, and 6 Gy. Combinatorial effects were evaluated through proliferation and clonogenic capacity assays. Treatment with BI 2536 caused mitotic arrest after 24 hours, and increased apoptosis in GBM cells. Moreover, our results demonstrate that pretreatment with this drug sensitized six out of seven GBM cell lines to different doses of c-irradiation as shown by decreased growth and abrogation of colony-formation capacity. Our data suggest that PLK1 blockage has a radiosensitizing effect on GBM, which could improve treatment strategies for this devastating tumor.",https//www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/cbr.2012.1415
3764,"Receptor tyrosine kinase targeting in glioblastoma performance, limitations and future approaches","Gliomas are a group of brain tumors originating from the glial cells (either astrocytic or oligodendroglial). Their classification is based on cell biology, histology and clinical evolution. Although the current classification of brain tumors includes genetic and epigenetic abnormalities and clinico-pathological features, clinicians are still using the historical classification to define the tumor entities. Until recently, gliomas were divided into low-grade gliomas (LGGs) (grade I-II) and high-grade gliomas (HGGs) (grade III and IV), according to the 2007 report of the WHO classification  . The WHO presented in 2016 a major restructuring of the embryonal central nervous system tumors, by incorporating new entities defined both by molecular and histological features, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, IDH-mutant glioblastoma; H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma; RELA fusion-positive ependymoma; WNT-and SHH-activated medulloblastoma; and C19MC-altered multilayered rosettes embryonal tumor  . There are several studies showing that the molecular background of the discussed entity is very complex   . Basically, because of the discrepancies in the clinical evolution of tumors with different molecular background, this classification is a problematic issue. HGGs are the most aggressive brain tumors among gliomas. The median survival of patients diagnosed with HGGs is only 14.6 months  . HGGs include anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) and glioblastoma (GB). The origin of these tumors is in the supporting neuroglial cells of the central nervous system. The most aggressive of these primary brain tumors are GB. It is obvious that GB individuals require special attention and care, mainly because all HGGs can be debilitating, causing physical and cognitive impairment, epileptic seizures, depression and personality changes. In the last years, specialists have focused their energy on providing new therapies for these patients, in order to improve their lifestyle and survival. In spite of the efforts made until now, the standard of care of newly diagnosed GB remains surgery (maximal safe resection) followed by radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy    . The adjuvant temozolomide associated with radiotherapy has improved the median survival, which was only 12.1 months. However, several problems linked to resistance towards chemotherapy or radiotherapy need to be solved. Microenvironment, cellular morphology and genetic characteristics are a few of the aspects to which cancer cells can adapt in order to survive, leading to drug resistance  . In the light of these data, it is obvious that the decisions regarding the treatment must be taken on an individual basis.","From all central nervous system tumors, gliomas are the most common. Nowadays, researchers are looking for more efficient treatments for these tumors, as well as ways for early diagnosis. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are major targets for oncology and the development of small-molecule RTK inhibitors has been proven successful in cancer treatment. Mutations or aberrant activation of the RTKs and their intracellular signaling pathways are linked to several malignant diseases, including glioblastoma. The progress in the understanding of malignant glioma evolution has led to RTK targeted therapies with high capacity to improve the therapeutic response while reducing toxicity. In this review, we present the most important RTKs (i.e. EGFR, IGFR, PDGFR and VEGFR) currently used for developing cancer therapeutics together with the potential of RTK-related drugs in glioblastoma treatment. Also, we focus on some therapeutic agents that are currently at different stages of research or even in clinical phases and proved to be suitable as re-purposing candidates for glioblastoma treatment.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7265959/pdf/WO-24-94726.pdf
3820,Using the molecular classification of glioblastoma to inform personalized treatment,"Glioblastoma is a uniformly fatal extremely heterogeneous disease. Tumour heterogeneity translates into histological patterns  , genetic alterations and gene expression profiles    . The current treatment for glioblastoma is maximal surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (the Stupp regimen)  . Recent genetic molecular advances have contributed to a better understanding of glioblastoma pathophysiology. In this paper we review the basic glioblastoma pathophysiology, emphasizing the clinically relevant genetic molecular alterations and potential targets for further drug development. Glioblastoma may be divided into two identical morphological subtypes, based on the presence or absence of a precursor lesion. Primary glioblastoma is the most common type (∼90%); it arises de novo, without evidence of a precursor lesion, and is common in older adults (>50 years). Secondary glioblastoma represents progression from a pre-existent, lower-grade astrocytoma (WHO grades II or III)  . The time to progression from diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II) to glioblastoma is longer (∼5 years) than the time to progression from anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) (∼2 years)  . However, this is not always the rule. In our experience, we have seen instances of protracted progression of diffuse astrocytoma to glioblastoma of ≥10years or anaplastic astrocytomas progressing extremely fast to glioblastoma in <1 year time frame  .","Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive diffuse glioma, associated with short survival and uniformly fatal outcome, irrespective of treatment. It is characterized by morphological, genetic and gene-expression heterogeneity. The current standard of treatment is maximal surgical resection, followed by radiation, with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy. Due to the heterogeneity, most tumours develop resistance to treatment and shortly recur. Following recurrence, glioblastoma is quickly fatal in the majority of cases. Recent genetic molecular advances have contributed to a better understanding of glioblastoma pathophysiology and disease stratification. In this paper we review basic glioblastoma pathophysiology, with emphasis on clinically relevant genetic molecular alterations and potential targets for further drug development.

3861,Molecularly Targeted Therapies for Glioma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary malignant brain tumor. Although considerable progress has been made using multidisciplinary multimodal treatment approaches to surgical and radiation treatment for glioma patients, the impact of these advances on clinical outcomes has been disappointing. GBM is defined by the features of uncontrolled cellular proliferation, diffuse infiltration, necrosis, robust angiogenesis, intense resistance to apoptosis, and genomic instability. Invasive tumor cells escape surgical removal as well as exposure to radiation and chemotherapy. Recent improved understanding of the biochemical and molecular determinants of glioma has provided valuable insights into the underlying biological features of the disease, as well as illuminating possible new therapeutic targets.","Over the past decade, molecularly targeted therapies have been added to cytotoxic and antiendocrine drugs in the treatment of cancer, with the aim of targeting the molecular pathways that underlie the carcinogenic process and maintain the cancer phenotype. Success with some of these agents has suggested that identification and validation of drug targets is the starting point for the development of active, safe, and effective drugs. The main molecular targets used to develop anticancer drugs are cell surface receptors, signal transduction pathways, gene transcription targets, ubiquitin-proreasome/heat shock proteins, and tumor micro-environment components. Here, we review the development of the main molecularly targeted noncytotoxic agents studied in glioma, highlighting lessons derived from the development of these novel drugs and proposing new horizons for the clinical development of molecularly targeted therapies.

3900,Functional Blockade of Small GTPase RAN Inhibits Glioblastoma Cell Viability,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive tumor generally found in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. Spanning 16% of the cases of all primary tumors in the brain and ∼50% of all malignant brain tumors, GBM is the most common malignant type in the central nervous system   . The average length of survival for GBM patients is ∼15 months, and only about 5.5% of patients will live longer than 5 years after diagnosis and aggressive treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical resection     . However, surgery is not sufficient for a clean and complete resection of the tumor mass due to the infiltration of tumor cells into the normal brain parenchyma. The remaining tumor cells are often refractory to chemo drugs and radiation, thereby contributing to the high incidence of tumor recurrence that is robustly associated with a poor prognosis of GBM     . Therefore, more effective treatments are needed.","Glioblastoma, the most common malignant tumor in the brain, lacks effective treatments and is currently incurable. To identify novel drug targets for this deadly cancer, the publicly available results of RNA interference screens from the Project Achilles database were analyzed. Ten candidate genes were identified as survival genes in 15 glioblastoma cell lines. RAN, member RAS oncogene family (RAN) was expressed in glioblastoma at the highest level among all candidates based upon cDNA microarray data. However, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis did not show any correlation between RAN mRNA levels and patient survival. Because RAN is a small GTPase that regulates nuclear transport controlled by karyopherin subunit beta 1 (KPNB1), RAN was further analyzed together with KPNB1. Indeed, GBM patients with high levels of RAN also had more KPNB1 and levels of KPNB1 alone did not relate to patient prognosis. Through a Cox multivariate analysis, GBM patients with high levels of RAN and KPNB1 showed significantly shorter life expectancy when temozolomide and promoter methylation of O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase were used as covariates. These results indicate that RAN and KPNB1 together are associated with drug resistance and GBM poor prognosis. Furthermore, the functional blockade of RAN and KPNB1 by importazole remarkably suppressed cell viability and activated apoptosis in GBM cells expressing high levels of RAN, while having a limited effect on astrocytes and GBM cells with undetectable RAN. Together, our results demonstrate that RAN activity is important for GBM survival and the functional blockade of RAN/KPNB1 is an appealing therapeutic approach.",https//fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/423014/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fonc-08-00662/fonc-08-00662.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=i8kwzK%2BXgaepSp7C%2BstXemqwFEYbJtbZN647%2BY51WU0%3D&se=2021-03-02T02%3A32%3A50Z&sp=r&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27fonc-08-00662.pdf
3932,Afatinib and Temozolomide combination inhibits tumorigenesis by targeting EGFRvIII-cMet signaling in glioblastoma cells,"Glioblastoma (GBM) accounts for 45.6% of malignant brain tumors and is universally fatal  . Despite the multimodality treatment options available to newly diagnosed GBM patients including surgical resection, radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ)-based concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy  , tumor recurrence is inevitable and results in poor median progression-free survival (PFS) (6.9 months)  . Scant progress has been made in the last decade to improve survival   .","Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with universal recurrence and poor prognosis. The recurrence is largely driven by chemoradiation resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its mutant EGFRvIII are amplified in similar to 60% and similar to 30% of GBM patients, respectively; however, therapies targeting EGFR have failed to improve disease outcome. EGFRvIII-mediated cross-activation of tyrosine kinase receptor, cMET, regulates GBM CSC maintenance and promote tumor recurrence. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of pan-EGFR inhibitor afatinib and Temozolomide (TMZ) combination on GBM in vitro and in vivo.sWe analyzed the effect of afatinib and temozolomide (TMZ) combination on GBM cells U87MG and U251 engineered to express wild type (WT) EGFR, EGFRvIII or EGFRvIII dead kinase, CSCs isolated from U87 and U87EGFRvIII in vitro. The therapeutic utility of the drug combination was investigated on tumor growth and progression using intracranially injected U87EGFRvIII GBM xenografts.Afatinib and TMZ combination synergistically inhibited the proliferation, clonogenic survival, motility, invasion and induced senescence of GBM cells compared to monotherapy. Mechanistically, afatinib decreased U87EGFRvIII GBM cell proliferation and motility/invasion by inhibiting EGFRvIII/AKT, EGFRvIII/JAK2/STAT3, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways respectively. Interestingly, afatinib specifically inhibited EGFRvIII-cMET crosstalk in CSCs, resulting in decreased expression of Nanog and Oct3/4, and in combination with TMZ significantly decreased their self-renewal property in vitro. More interestingly, afatinib and TMZ combination significantly decreased the xenograft growth and progression compared to single drug alone.Our study demonstrated significant inhibition of GBM tumorigenicity, CSC maintenance in vitro, and delayed tumor growth and progression in vivo by combination of afatinib and TMZ. Our results warrant evaluation of this drug combination in EGFR and EGFRvIII amplified GBM patients.",https//jeccr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13046-019-1264-2.pdf
3968,Combining drugs and radiotherapy from the bench to the bedside,"Malignant gliomas are treatment-resistant tumors for which curative therapies remain elusive. The addition of temozolomide has been found to significantly improve outcome compared to radiation alone, but this improvement, while significant, remains marginal for most. Patients with epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene promoter appeared to benefit the most from the addition of temozolomide chemotherapy in the upfront setting. Patients whose tumors harbor an unmethylated gene promoter and patients with recurrent tumors are left with few effective treatment options. The wealth of novel therapeutics being discovered and developed for other systemic cancers have created a pipeline of drugs that are promising for investigation in brain tumor patients. Targeted therapies aimed at angiogenesis and at key signal transduction pathways regulating cellular survival represent promising attempts to approach malignant glioma therapy in a new way with potentially improved patient outcomes. This article provides an overview on various targeted therapeutic approaches for malignant gliomas under current investigation, as well as future directions."," of reviewThe current standard care of treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is never curative and exclusively involves the use of cytoxics upfront (e.g., radiation and chemotherapy). Current clinical protocols involve the use of single-agent targeted therapies, which inhibit specific pathways. Given the functional redundancies present in human tumors and escape mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that such a monotherapy approach will be successful in the treatment of GBM. Future directions of therapy for GBMs will likely involve the use of therapeutic cocktails, including more than one target specific inhibitors based on tumor escape mechanism, genetic, epigenetic and molecular signatures. This review addresses some of the relevant issues.Recent findingsCorrelative clinical studies from various clinical trials and preclinical studies have provided the meticulous use of chemotherapeutics and radiation based on molecular profiling of tumors. Alkylating agents such as temozolomide lose their efficacy if DNA repair enzyme expression is upregulated. The alternative strategies include targeting the enzyme or one can use poly (ADP) ribose inhibitor to inhibit base excision repair pathway rather than mismatch repair pathway. Currently, several inhibitors in this category are in clinical trials. Next, we have addressed new avenues including radiosensitizers, hypoxia, metabolism, angiogenesis, invasive and infiltrative nature of tumors and potential molecular targets, which can be exploited for clinical trials. Finally, we have included some aspect of genome-wide association studies and correlative analysis and the lessons learned to design better clinical trials.SummaryAdvances in profiling the noncoding RNAs, genetic, epigenetic profiles, metabolomics, genomics and proteomics may uncover important resistance mechanisms in GBM. Personalized therapy using various therapeutic cocktails targeting these resistance mechanisms may prove even more effective in the future management of GBMs.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3209519/pdf/nihms-206790.pdf
3985,Spatiotemporal genomic architecture informs precision oncology in glioblastoma,"Most clinical trials for targeted therapy in GBM have shown limited clinical success  . Although recent genome-wide studies evaluating regional heterogeneity   and longitudinal GBM pairs     have suggested potential evolutionary models of the tumors, there is little understanding regarding which strategies can effectively use genomic data to inform targeted therapies. To identify such strategies, we analyzed somatic variants in 127 multiregion or longitudinal tumor specimens from 52 individuals with glioma 42 individuals from the Samsung Medical Center (SMC), Seoul, and 10 individuals from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM cohort    (Supplementary Table 1 ). Additionally, we analyzed the transcriptomes of 83 tumor specimens from 41 individuals (bulk) and 305 single cells from 7 samples for 3 individuals. Tumors were classified into four distinct groups according to the spatial and temporal features of tissue acquisition tumors obtained from the same location at the same time (locally adjacent), tumors obtained from different locations at the same time (multifocal/multicentric; referred to as multiple)  , and tumors obtained from local and distant recurrences at different times (longitudinal local and distant, respectively) ( Fig. 1a) .","Precision medicine in cancer proposes that genomic characterization of tumors can inform personalized targeted therapies1-5. However, this proposition is complicated by spatial and temporal heterogeneity6-14. Here we study genomic and expression profiles across 127 multisector or longitudinal specimens from 52 individuals with glioblastoma (GBM). Using bulk and single-cell data, we find that samples from the same tumor mass share genomic and expression signatures, whereas geographically separated, multifocal tumors and/or long-term recurrent tumors are seeded from different clones. Chemical screening of patient-derived glioma cells (PDCs) shows that therapeutic response is associated with genetic similarity, and multifocal tumors that are enriched with PIK3CA mutations have a heterogeneous drug-response pattern. We show that targeting truncal events is more efficacious than targeting private events in reducing the tumor burden. In summary, this work demonstrates that evolutionary inference from integrated genomic analysis in multisector biopsies can inform targeted therapeutic interventions for patients with GBM.",https//www.nature.com/articles/ng.3806.pdf
4005,F-18-Fluciclovine PET to distinguish treatment-related effects from disease progression in recurrent glioblastoma PET fusion with MRI guides neurosurgical sampling,"Glioblastoma (GB) invariably recurs, but surveillance with MRI remains problematic for the discrimination of tumor recurrence from treatment-related effects, that is, pseudoprogression or radionecrosis. Because chemoradiation treatment alone induces radiographic changes in approximately half of treated patients,  radiographic progression without actual underlying disease progression is recognized as a major clinical dilemma in caring for patients with GB.  Although pathological confirmation is the most reliable method to differentiate progressive disease from treatment effect, it is an invasive method; therefore, numerous noninvasive methods have been attempted to discriminate the  distinct entities, including diffusion-weighted imaging, various perfusion imaging techniques, and PET.  To date, most clinicians rely on advanced MRI techniques such as dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI perfusion techniques to tease out a distinction between recurrent tumor vs treatment effect; however, there is considerable variability between institutions in optimal thresholds and a lack of standardization that limits Henderson et al. PET in recurrent glioblastoma the application of these techniques.  As such, it is difficult to identify patients who can benefit from additional surgery, as in cases of disease recurrence, vs patients who are experiencing treatment efficacy, particularly in an era of multiple pharmacological options (ie, temozolomide, bevacizumab, targeted therapy, and promising immunotherapy trials).  8 F-Fluciclovine (Axumin®; Blue Earth Diagnostics), a synthetic amino acid PET tracer, has been used to identify cancer spread in prostate and breast cancer   but its utility in GB is an area of active research. Its low uptake in normal brain, selective tumor uptake, and high lesion-to-background contrast profile (vs other commonly used tracers) make 8 F-fluciclovine an attractive agent.   We therefore investigated this tracer's use and report  cases of patients undergoing surgery for recurrent GB that demonstrate the feasibility of 8 F-fluciclovine PET plus MRI imaging to guide surgical sampling.","Differentiation of true tumor progression from treatment-related effects remains a major unmet need in caring for patients with glioblastoma. Here, we report how the intraoperative combination of MRI with (1)(8) F-fluciclovine PET guided surgical sampling in 2 patients with recurrent glioblastoma. F-18-Fluciclovine PET is FDA approved for use in prostate cancer and carries an orphan drug designation in glioma.To investigate its utility in recurrent glioblastoma, we fused PET and MRI images using 2 different surgical navigation systems and performed targeted stereotactic biopsies from the areas of high (""hot"") and low (""cold"") radiotracer uptake. Concordant histopathologic and imaging findings suggest that a combined( 1)(8)F-fluciclovne PET-MRI-guided approach can guide neurosurgical resection of viable recurrent glioblastoma in the background of treatment-related effects, which can otherwise look similar on MRI.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081387/pdf/npz068.pdf
4016,Prospective Feasibility Trial for Genomics-Informed Treatment in Recurrent and Progressive Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is a rapidly progressing disease with poor outcome, with a median overall survival (OS) of less than 15 months for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma  . Though glioblastoma is a genetically diverse tumor type with multiple molecular subgroups, the current standard-of-care treatment of maximally safe surgical resection followed by temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy both during and after radiotherapy is broadly applied across patients with glioblastoma. Alternating electric fields used in combination with TMZ in the adjuvant setting were recently shown in an open label, phase III trial to improve median survival and OS in newly diagnosed disease  ; currently, no patient-specific predictive biomarkers are associated with use of this device."," Glioblastoma is an aggressive and molecularly heterogeneous cancer with few effective treatment options. We hypothesized that next-generation-sequencing can be used to guide treatment recommendations within a clinically acceptable time frame following surgery for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.Experimental Design We conducted a prospective genomics-informed feasibility trial in adults with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma. Following surgical resection, genome-wide tumor/normal exome sequencing and tumor RNA sequencing were performed to identify molecular targets for potential matched therapy. A multidisciplinary molecular tumor board issued treatment recommendations based on the genomic results, blood-brain barrier penetration of the indicated therapies, drug-drug interactions, and drug safety profiles. Feasibility of generating genomics-informed treatment recommendations within 35 days of surgery was assessed. Of the 20 patients enrolled in the study, 16 patients had sufficient tumor tissue for analysis. Exome sequencing was completed for all patients, and RNA sequencing was completed for 14 patients. Treatment recommendations were provided within the study's feasibility time frame for 15 of 16 (94%) patients. Seven patients received treatment based on the tumor board recommendations. Two patients reached 12-month progression-free survival, both adhering to treatments based on the molecular profiling results. One patient remained on treatment and progression free 21 months after surgery, 3 times longer than the patient's previous time to progression. Analysis of matched nonenhancing tissue from 12 patients revealed overlapping as well as novel putatively actionable genomic alterations. Use of genome-wide molecular profiling is feasible and can be informative for guiding real-time, central nervous system-penetrant, genomics-informed treatment recommendations for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

4057,CXCL12 modulation of CXCR4 and CXCR7 activity in human glioblastoma stem-like cells and regulation of the tumor microenvironment,"Chemokines (CKs) and their cognate receptors are constitutively expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) where they control complex physiological functions. In particular, the pleiotropic chemokine CXCL12 (formerly known as stromal-cell derived factor-alpha, SDF1-α) and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 are key regulators in CNS development, and are involved in neuromodulation, neuroprotection, and control the interactions between neurons, microglia and astrocytes in adult brain  . Altered expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 has also been associated to CNS diseases, such as HIV encephalopathy, stroke and multiple sclerosis, among others   . A role for CXCL12 modulation of CXCR4 and CXCR7 was identified for most of the brain tumors including gliomas, meningiomas and even pituitary adenomas that frequently overexpress these receptors    . In this review we analyze the role of CKs in glioblastoma (GBM) development, diffusion and recurrence.","Chemokines are crucial autocrine and paracrine players in tumor development. In particular, CXC L12, through its receptors CXCR4 and CXC R7, affects tumor progression by controlling cancer cell survival, proliferation and migration, and, indirectly, via angiogenesis or recruiting immune cells. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor in adults and despite current multimodal therapies it remains almost incurable. The aggressive and recurrent phenotype of GB M is ascribed to high growth rate, invasiveness to normal brain, marked angiogenesis, ability to escape the immune system and resistance to standard of care therapies. Tumor molecular and cellular heterogeneity severely hinders GBM therapeutic improvement. In particular, a subpopulation of chemo- and radio-therapy resistant tumorigenic cancer stem like cells (CSCs) is believed to be the main responsible for tumor cell dissemination to the brain. GBM cells display heterogeneous expression levels of CXCR4 and CXCR7 that are overexpressed in CSCs, representing a molecular correlate for the invasive potential of GBM. The microenvironment contribution in GBM development is increasingly emphasized. An interplay exists between CSCs, differentiated GBM cells, and the microenvironment, mainly through secreted chemokines (e.g., CXCL12) causing recruitment of fibroblasts, endothelial, mesenchymal and inflammatory cells to the tumor, via specific receptors such as CXCR4. This review covers recent developments on the role of CXCL12/CXCR4 CXCR7 networks in GBM progression and the potential translational impact of their targeting. The biological and molecular understanding of the heterogeneous GBM cell behavior, phenotype and signaling is still limited. Progress in the identification of chemokine-dependent mechanisms that affect GBM cell survival, trafficking and chemo-attractive functions, opens new perspectives for development of more specific therapeutic approaches that include chemokine-based drugs.",https//fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/92342/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fncel-08-00144/fncel-08-00144.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=zyMQAxTsjsiRFFlbgf%2FL7p278GaSbVjVK3PL2hjOi4A%3D&se=2021-03-02T02%3A41%3A48Z&sp=r&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27fncel-08-00144.pdf
4139,"Genetic, Epigenetic, and Immunologic Profiling of MMR-Deficient Relapsed Glioblastoma","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant type of brain cancer, almost invariably relapsing after standard therapy, which includes surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide (TMZ)-based chemotherapy. The genetics of GBM at diagnosis has been extensively investigated, and most driver mutations in GBM have been identified   . Nevertheless, targeted therapeutic approaches for GBM with clear impact on survival are still unavailable  . Among various reasons, marked intratumoral genetic heterogeneity could play a leading role, as it endorses rapid tumor adaptation to target therapy ( . Accordingly, it has been shown that only few alterations are shared between GBM at diagnosis and at relapse, supporting the hypothesis of therapy-driven selection of tumor cell subpopulations not prevalent in the initial tumor    . For these reasons, GBM genotyping at relapse along with improved characterization of the tumor microenvironment represent fundamental steps which could be useful in the identification of targets not present at tumor onset."," In-depth characterization of recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) might contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind tumor progression and enable rGBM treatment with targeted drugs.Experimental Design In this study, GBM samples were collected at diagnosis and recurrence from adult patients treated with Stupp protocol. Expression of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was evaluated by IHC, followed by whole exome sequencing (WES) of tumor samples showing loss of MSH6 reactivity. Established genetic, epigenetic, and immunologic markers were assessed by standard methods and correlated with loss of MMR proteins and patient survival. Expression of MMR proteins was partially or completely lost in 25.9% rGBM samples. Specifically, 12 samples showed partial or total MSH6 expression reduction. Conversely, 96.4% of GBM samples at diagnosis expressed MMR markers. WES disclosed lack of variants in MMR genes in primary samples, whereas two MSH6-negative rGBM samples shared a c.3438+ 1G>A* splicing MSH6 variant with a potential loss of function effect. MSH6-negative rGBM specimens had high tumor mutational burden (TMB), but no microsatellite instability. In contrast, GBM samples with partial loss of MMR proteins disclosed low TMB. MMR-deficient rGBM showed significant telomere shortening and MGMT methylation and are characterized by highly heterogeneous MHC class I expression. Multilevel profiling of MMR-deficient rGBM uncovered hypermutated genotype uncoupled from enriched expression of immune-related markers. Assessment of MHC class I expression and TMB should be included in protocols aiming to identify rGBM patients potentially eligible for treatment with drugs targeting immune-checkpoint inhibitors.",https//clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/25/6/1828.full.pdf

4225,Lessons learned in the development of targeted therapy for malignant gliomas,"Malignant gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumors affecting f16,000 new patients every year in the United States. The term malignant glioma comprises WHO grade IV tumors, such as glioblastomas with its variants, and WHO grade III tumors (anaplastic forms of astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma). Glioblastoma is by far the most frequent malignant glioma and is associated with a particularly aggressive course and dismal prognosis. Despite numerous clinical trials, little improvement in overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) has been achieved in the past 20 years. Surgical resection and radiotherapy have been the mainstay of treatment; only recently have the benefits of chemotherapy been unequivocally shown in a randomized trial  . In that study, the combination of temozolomide with radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide was tested against radiotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The chemotherapy arm achieved improved OS (median, 15 months versus 12 months; 2-year OS, 27% versus 10%) and PFS (median, 7 months versus 5 months). Despite the clear benefit, such improvements remain modest from a clinical standpoint. Outcomes in recurrent or progressive glioblastoma are even less favorable (median OS, 6 -7 months; median PFS, 2 -3 months; refs. 2, 3), reflecting the minimal benefits of salvage treatment. WHO grade III tumors have a relatively better prognosis, with a median OS of 2 to 4 years for newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytomas and 3 to 5 years for anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, which are chemosensitive tumors  ). Yet, even for those, recurrence is the norm, and disease will follow a fatal course in virtually all patients with malignant glioma. New treatment alternatives, such as molecular targeted therapy, are thus clearly needed.","The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma remains poor despite standard treatment with radiotherapy and temozolomide. Molecular targeted therapy holds the promise of providing new, more effective treatment options with minimal toxicity. However, the development of targeted therapy for gliomas has been particularly challenging. The oncogenetic process in such tumors is driven by several signaling pathways that are differentially activated or silenced with both parallel and converging complex interactions. Therefore, it has been difficult to identify prevalent targets that act as key promoters of oncogenesis and that can be successfully addressed by novel agents. Several drugs have been tested, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin). Although preliminary efficacy results of most trials in recurrent disease have fallen short on expectations, substantial advances have been achieved by associated translational research. In this article, we seek to recapitulate the lessons learned in the development of targeted therapy for gliomas, including challenges and pitfalls in the interpretation of preclinical data, specific issues in glioma trial design, insights provided by translational research, changes in paradigms, and future perspectives.",https//mct.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanther/6/7/1909.full.pdf

Safety of bevacizumab treatment in patients with glioblastoma 6. Discussion,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and devastating primary malignant intracranial tumor in adults. The current first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed GBM is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. This treatment protocol may prolong the survival period of the patient, however it is not curative and more effective therapeutic strategies are required. GBM is a type of highly vascularized tumor with increased expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a significant mediator of angiogenesis. Since angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth, anti-angiogenic therapies hold potential for the treatment of GBM, and targeting VEGF has demonstrated promising results in previous studies. Bevacizumab (BEV) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a monotherapy treatment for patients with recurrent GBM and is associated with manageable toxicity. Previous studies have demonstrated that BEV may be an effective treatment for recurrent GBM, with prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival, and maintained patient quality of life and functional status. The present review article briefly outlines the mechanism of action of BEV and summarizes the current literature and clinical trial research on the role of BEV for the treatment of patients with recurrent and newly diagnosed GBM.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4733960/pdf/etm-11-02-0371.pdf

By administering therapeutic agents directly to the brain interstitium and, more specifically, to tumor-infiltrated parenchyma, one can overcome the elevated interstitial pressure produced by brain tumors. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) has emerged as a leading investigational delivery technique for the treatment of brain tumors. Clinical trials utilizing these methods have been completed, with mixed results, and several more are being initiated. However, the potential efficacy of these drugs may be limited by ineffective tissue distribution. The development of computer models/algorithms to predict drug distribution, new catheter designs, and utilization of tracer models and nanocarriers have all laid the groundwork for the advancement of CED, In this review, we summarize the recent post of the clinical trials utilizing CED and discuss emerging technologies that will shape future CED trials.",https//www.futuremedicine.com/doi/pdfplus/10.2217/fon.09.135
4320,Emergence of FGFR family gene fusions as therapeutic targets in a wide spectrum of solid tumours,"Cancer, which evolves from cells that have lost the ability to maintain homeostatic proliferation, death, movement, and invasion, was first postulated to originate via acquired chromosomal abnormalities by Boveri in 1914  . In the 1940s, efforts aimed at implementing cancer therapies that targeted the neoplastic phenotype increased cancer cell proliferation. Since then, DNA-damaging anti-neoplastic agents have remained the most widely used class of chemotherapeutic agents for cancers. The numerous adverse effects as well as resistance observed with antineoplastic agents (traditional chemotherapy agents, such as platinum and alkylating agents) motivated the push towards targeted therapy. Targeted therapies are available for a wide array of cancers, including leukaemias, gastric cancers, and non-small cell lung cancer. However, adverse effects remain because the targeted molecules also exist in healthy cells, albeit at a lower level. Furthermore, diagnosing cancer subtypes to determine treatment selection could be troublesome when the molecule is also found in the surrounding healthy tissue. Identification of a molecule that exists solely in tumour tissue would serve as a site-specific target and diagnostic tool, resulting in even more potent and selective treatment options.","The emergence of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family fusions across diverse cancers has brought attention to FGFR-derived cancer therapies. The discovery of the first recurrent FGFR fusion in glioblastoma was followed by discoveries of FGFR fusions in bladder, lung, breast, thyroid, oral, and prostate cancers. Drug targeting of FGFR fusions has shown promising results and should soon be translating into clinical trials. FGFR fusions form as a result of various mechanisms-predominantly deletion for FGFR1, translocation for FGFR2, and tandem duplication for FGFR3. The ability to exploit the unique targetability of FGFR fusions proves that FGFR-derived therapies could have a promising future in cancer therapeutics. Drug targeting of fusion genes has proven to be an extremely effective therapeutic approach for cancers such as the recurrent BCR-ABL1 fusion in chronic myeloid leukaemia. The recent discovery of recurrent FGFR family fusions in several cancer types has brought to attention the unique therapeutic potential for FGFR-positive patients. Understanding the diverse mechanisms of FGFR fusion formation and their oncogenic potential will shed light on the impact of FGFR-derived therapy in the future.

4354,Current status of boron neutron capture therapy of high grade gliomas and recurrent head and neck cancer,"Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the nuclear capture and fission reactions that occur when boron-10, which is a non-radioactive constituent of natural elemental boron, is irradiated with low energy (0.025 eV) thermal neutrons. This results in the production of high linear energy transfer (LET) alpha particles ( 4 He) and recoiling lithium-7 ( 7 Li) nuclei, as shown below.","Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a biochemically targeted radiotherapy based on the nuclear capture and fission reactions that occur when non-radioactive boron-10, which is a constituent of natural elemental boron, is irradiated with low energy thermal neutrons to yield high linear energy transfer alpha particles and recoiling lithium-7 nuclei. Clinical interest in BNCT has focused primarily on the treatment of high grade gliomas, recurrent cancers of the head and neck region and either primary or metastatic melanoma. Neutron sources for BNCT currently have been limited to specially modified nuclear reactors, which are or until the recent Japanese natural disaster, were available in Japan, United States, Finland and several other European countries, Argentina and Taiwan. Accelerators producing epithermal neutron beams also could be used for BNCT and these are being developed in several countries. It is anticipated that the first Japanese accelerator will be available for therapeutic use in 2013. The major hurdle for the design and synthesis of boron delivery agents has been the requirement for selective tumor targeting to achieve boron concentrations in the range of 20 mu g/g. This would be sufficient to deliver therapeutic doses of radiation with minimal normal tissue toxicity. Two boron drugs have been used clinically, a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, referred to as boronophenylalanine or ""BPA"", and sodium borocaptate or ""BSH"" (Na2B12H11SH). In this report we will provide an overview of other boron delivery agents that currently are under evaluation, neutron sources in use or under development for BNCT, clinical dosimetry, treatment planning, and finally a summary of previous and on-going clinical studies for high grade gliomas and recurrent tumors of the head and neck region. Promising results have been obtained with both groups of patients but these outcomes must be more rigorously evaluated in larger, possibly randomized clinical trials. Finally, we will summarize the critical issues that must be addressed if BNCT is to become a more widely established clinical modality for the treatment of those malignancies for which there currently are no good treatment options.",https//ro-journal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1748-717X-7-146.pdf
4394,Recent insights into the pathophysiology of mTOR pathway dysregulation,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is amongst the most widely studied complexes due to its fundamental importance in cell biology and cell signaling mechanisms. mTOR is expressed in all cells as it plays a critical role in cell growth, proliferation and migration, and is essential in normal development. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling leads to various human pathological conditions including neurological diseases, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular complications. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to understand how to counterbalance this dysregulation in order to reverse or impede disease progression.","Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) dysregulation is present in a variety of human pathologies including neurological disease, cancer, diabetes, and cardiac disease. Hyperactivation leads to increased protein synthesis and cell growth, which are essential for growth, development, and cancer. Inhibition of mTOR results in induction of autophagy, a cell survival mechanism thought to be deficient in neurodegeneration. Counteracting the balance of mTOR signaling with target specific inhibitors is of interest in pathological conditions where mTOR signaling is upregulated. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of rapamycin for treatment of renal cell, pancreatic neuroendocrine, and hormone positive breast cancer. Many clinical trials are underway to determine the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in other pathologies as monotherapies or combinational therapies with chemotherapeutics, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, molecular targeted therapies, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors.

4443,Dovitinib enhances temozolomide efficacy in glioblastoma cells,"The FDA-approved oral drug dovitinib (Dov; TKI258, CHIR258; DOV) inhibits the tyrosine kinases FGFR, PDGFR-b, VEGFR, and c-KIT, has manageable toxicity, and distributes extensively in tissues  . In addition to its multityrosine kinase inhibitory functions, Dov binds to the DNA minor groove and acts as a topoisomerases I and II poison causing DNA damage  . Several phase I/II/III clinical trials revealed that when used as monotherapy, Dov showed only moderate overall efficacy in patient in a variety of solid tumors         . Increased sensitivity to Dov was reported in patients with a RET G207A germline variant  and in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma  , FGFR2-mutant endometrial cancer cells  , and BCR-ABL + leukemia cells  . A beneficial role of Dov comes from combinatorial therapies. In vitro and mouse xenograft studies demonstrated a significant benefit in using a combined treatment of Dov with platinum compounds in colon cancer  and with mTOR inhibitors in hepatocellular  and basal cell breast carcinoma  . The combination of Dov and mTOR inhibitor was also found effective in two clinical trials with metastatic renal cancer patients   , whereas a third trial study reported only modest activity in patients with VEGFrefractory clear cell renal cancer  . A combination of Dov and the antiestrogenic drug fulvestrant (ICI-182.780) showed a significant in vitro antiproliferative activity in human endometrial cancer cells  and promising clinical activity in a phase II trial with hormone receptor-positive, HER2+ breast cancer patients  .","The multikinase inhibitor and FDA-approved drug dovitinib (Dov) crosses the blood-brain barrier and was recently used as single drug application in clinical trials for GB patients with recurrent disease. The Dov-mediated molecular mechanisms in GB cells are unknown. We used GB patient cells and cell lines to show that Dov downregulated the stem cell protein Lin28 and its target high-mobility group protein A2 (HMGA2). The Dov-induced reduction in pSTAT3(Tyr705) phosphorylation demonstrated that Dov negatively affects the STAT3/LIN28/ Let-7/HMGA2 regulatory axis in GB cells. Consistent with the known function of LIN28 and HMGA2 in GB self-renewal, Dov reduced GB tumor sphere formation. Dov treatment also caused the downregulation of key base excision repair factors and O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), which are known to have important roles in the repair of temozolomide (TMZ)-induced alkylating DNA damage. Combined Dov/TMZ treatment enhanced TMZ-induced DNA damage as quantified by nuclear gamma H2AX foci and comet assays, and increased GB cell apoptosis. Pretreatment of GB cells with Dov ('Dov priming') prior to TMZ treatment reduced GB cell viability independent of p53 status. Sequential treatment involving 'Dov priming' and alternating treatment cycles with TMZ and Dov substantially reduced long-term GB cell survival in MGMT+ patient GB cells. Our results may have immediate clinical implications to improve TMZ response in patients with LIN28(+)/HMGA2(+) GB, independent of their MGMT methylation status.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537714/pdf/MOL2-11-1078.pdf
4485,Convection-enhanced delivery in glioblastoma a review of preclinical and clinical studies,"to diffuse 1 mm from its delivery site, which is far from ideal as a therapeutic method.  CED, initially conceptualized by Bobo et al. in 1994 as a local delivery strategy for the CNS, can overcome these limitations of diffusion-mediated delivery. CED involves stereotactically inserting 1 or more rigid cannulas containing soft catheters into tumors through bur holes. The catheters are proximally connected to a syringe pump containing the infusate, while their distal ends protrude out beyond the tip of the cannula(s) into the targeted tumor area, establishing a positive pressure gradient for hours to days.","Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor, and it carries an extremely poor prognosis. Attempts to develop targeted therapies have been hindered because the blood-brain barrier prevents many drugs from reaching tumors cells. Furthermore, systemic toxicity of drugs often limits their therapeutic potential. A number of alternative methods of delivery have been developed, one of which is convection-enhanced delivery (CED), the focus of this review. The authors describe CED as a therapeutic measure and review preclinical studies and the most prominent clinical trials of CED in the treatment of glioblastoma.

4512,EphA3 Pay-Loaded Antibody Therapeutics for the Treatment of Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive adult malignant brain cancer. Despite surgical resection, radiation, and temozolomide chemotherapy, median survival is approximately 15 months   . Brain cancer sufferers have not seen meaningful increases in overall survival for decades. This is, in large part, due to the highly infiltrative and heterogeneous nature of these aggressive tumours  . GBM also displays complex cellular hierarchies containing self-renewing glioma stem cells (GSCs) with the ability to re-populate the tumour post-therapy.","The EphA3 receptor has recently emerged as a functional tumour-specific therapeutic target in glioblastoma (GBM). EphA3 is significantly elevated in recurrent disease, is most highly expressed on glioma stem cells (GSCs), and has a functional role in maintaining self-renewal and tumourigenesis. An unlabelled EphA3-targeting therapeutic antibody is currently under clinical assessment in recurrent GBM patients. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of EphA3 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and radioimmunotherapy (RIT) approaches using orthotopic animal xenograft models. Brain uptake studies, using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, show EphA3 antibodies are effectively delivered across the blood-tumour barrier and accumulate at the tumour site with no observed normal brain reactivity. A robust anti-tumour response, with no toxicity, was observed using EphA3, ADC, and RIT approaches, leading to a significant increase in overall survival. Our current research provides evidence that GBM patients may benefit from pay-loaded EphA3 antibody therapies.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/cancers/cancers-10-00519/article_deploy/cancers-10-00519.pdf

In the year 2012, there will be an estimated 22,280 new cases and 15,500 deaths in the US alone  . Primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer are managed similarly to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). EOC is highly curable when it is confined to the ovaries, with up to 90% expected 5-year survival. However, EOC is rarely diagnosed at an early stage because the disease causes few specific symptoms when it is localized to the ovary.

Despite aggressive initial therapy, almost all patients with glioblastoma relapse and after first-line treatment failure there are limited treatment options for glioblastoma."," GDC-0084 is an oral, brain-penetrant small-molecule inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR. Because these two targets alter tumor vascularity and metabolism, respectively, we hypothesized multiparametric MR-PET could be used to quantify the response, estimate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, and predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.Patients and s Multiparametric advanced MR-PET imaging was performed to evaluate physiologic response in a first-in-man, multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of GDC-0084 (NCT01547546) in 47 patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Measured maximum concentration (C-max) was associated with a decrease in enhancing tumor volume (P = 0.0287) and an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA; P = 0.0418). Posttreatment tumor volume, F-18-FDG uptake, K-trans, and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were all correlated with C-max. A linear combination of change in F-18-FDG PET uptake, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, K-trans, v(p), and rCBV was able to estimate both C-max (R-2 = 0.4113; P < 0.0001) and drug exposure (AUC; R-2 = 0.3481; P < 0.0001). Using this composite multiparametric MR-PET imaging response biomarker to predict PK, patients with an estimated C-max > 0.1 mu mol/L and AUC > 1.25 mu mol/L*hour demonstrated significantly longer PFS compared with patients with a lower estimated concentration and exposure (P = 0.0039 and P = 0.0296, respectively).  from this study suggest composite biomarkers created from multiparametric MR-PET imaging targeting metabolic and/or physiologic processes specific to the drug mechanism of action may be useful for subsequent evaluation of treatment efficacy for larger phase II-III studies.",https//clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/26/13/3135.full.pdf
4594,EGFR and EGFRvIII undergo stress- and EGFR kinase inhibitor-induced mitochondrial translocalization A potential mechanism of EGFR-driven antagonism of apoptosis,"EGFR is an important mediator of normal cell growth and differentiation   . In cancer cells, EGFR is frequently over-expressed and is associated with tumor proliferation, progression and drug resistance    . EGFRvIII, a constitutively activated EGFR variant, is a product of rearrangement with an in-frame deletion of 801 bp of the coding sequence of the EGFR extracellular domain that results in a deletion of residues 6 through 273 and a glycine insertion as residue 6     . EGFR/EGFRvIII gene amplification is frequent in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and deadliest brain cancer in adults   ."," Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an essential role in normal development, tumorigenesis and malignant biology of human cancers, and is known to undergo intracellular trafficking to subcellular organelles. Although several studies have shown that EGFR translocates into the mitochondria in cancer cells, it remains unclear whether mitochondrially localized EGFR has an impact on the cells and whether EGFRvIII, a constitutively activated variant of EGFR, undergoes mitochondrial transport similar to EGFR. We report that both receptors translocate into the mitochondria of human glioblastoma and breast cancer cells, following treatments with the apoptosis inducers, staurosporine and anisomycin, and with an EGFR kinase inhibitor. Using mutant EGFR/EGFRvIII receptors engineered to undergo enriched intracellular trafficking into the mitochondria, we showed that glioblastoma cells expressing the mitochondrially enriched EGFRvIII were more resistant to staurosporine- and anisomycin-induced growth suppression and apoptosis and were highly resistant to EGFR kinase inhibitor-mediated growth inhibition. These findings indicate that apoptosis inducers and EGFR-targeted inhibitors enhance mitochondrial translocalization of both EGFR and EGFRvIII and that mitochondrial accumulation of these receptors contributes to tumor drug resistance. The findings also provide evidence for a potential link between the mitochondrial EGFR pathway and apoptosis.",https//molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1476-4598-10-26.pdf
4625,Strategies to improve delivery of anticancer drugs across the blood-brain barrier to treat glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor that remains essentially incurable despite decades of research on conventional and novel therapeutic strategies. Due to the invasive nature of GBM, aggressive surgical resection is insufficient to control tumors, and following maximal surgical resection, the addition of partial brain irradiation and temozolomide chemotherapy can significantly extend time to recurrence and survival. Unfortunately, despite this aggressive treatment regimen, the median survival for GBM patients remains 12 -15 months, and only 5% of patients survive longer than 5 years. As our understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate gliomagenesis and progression increases, integration of molecularly targeted agents into conventional chemoradiation regimens may provide a significant therapeutic benefit for patients with GBM. However, several factors may limit the efficacy of these promising therapeutic strategies, including molecular heterogeneity, invasion of tumor cells beyond the bulk tumor core delineated by imaging, and the blood -brain barrier (BBB), which prevents accumulation of xenobiotics within the central nervous system. These first 2 issues have been reviewed recently in this journal,  and here we provide an overview of the influence of the BBB on treatment efficacy in GBM patients and potential strategies to overcome this limitation.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal and aggressive brain tumor that is resistant to conventional radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapies. Molecularly targeted agents hold great promise in treating these genetically heterogeneous tumors, yet have produced disappointing results. One reason for the clinical failure of these novel therapies can be the inability of the drugs to achieve effective concentrations in the invasive regions beyond the bulk tumor. In this review, we describe the influence of the blood-brain barrier on the distribution of anticancer drugs to both the tumor core and infiltrative regions of GBM. We further describe potential strategies to overcome these drug delivery limitations.

4645,Antibody-drug conjugates in glioblastoma therapy the right drugs to the right cells,"Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary paren chymal central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm in adults. The survival of patients with glioblastoma remains poor, with median overall survival durations typically ranging from 14.6-16.8 months, and 24-month overall survival of 27-30%    . Multiple clinical trials of novel therapies for newly diagnosed patients have failed to improve overall survival, with the exception of the NovoTTF device combined with chemoradiation     . The NovoTTF devices have been described to inhibit tumour mitosis using externally applied, low-level electrical fields . Similarly, the search for therapies that effectively halt tumour progression has met with limited success. For patients with recurrent glioblastoma, chemotherapy regimens are associated with overall response rates of 4-9%, 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 10-19%, and median overall survival durations of 5-10 months      . Several studies of promising agents (such as the inhibitor of VEGF cediranib, or the inhibitor of PKCβ enzastaurin) conducted in the past decade did not demonstrate improved efficacy compared with standard-of-care chemotherapy in the recurrent tumour setting  11 . Bevacizumab was thought to be the most promising of these agents, and is associated with higher response rates (28-42%) and 6-month PFS (16-43%) than other agents, owing partly to the radio logical artefact of tumour vasculature pseudonormalisation  14 ;","Glioblastomas are high-grade brain tumours with a poor prognosis and, currently, few available therapeutic options. This lack of effective treatments has been linked to diverse factors, including target selection, tumour heterogeneity and poor penetrance of therapeutic agents through the blood-brain barrier and into tumours.

Most meningiomas are benign and respond to surgical resection and/or radiation therapy   . However, patients with the worst meningiomas, Grade III malignant have poor survival with few or no treatment options  . For recurrent meningiomas, which are found mostly in the Grade II and III, systematic chemotherapy   , α-interferon  , somatostatin analogues  , or VEGF inhibitors  have all been attempted, but with little success."," Meningiomas are a frequent tumor of the central nervous system. Although mostly benign, approximately 5% present as atypical or malignant tumors. Treatments for atypical meningiomas include gross total resection and radiotherapy, but about 33% of patients have recurrent tumors, sometimes as a higher grade. Recently, the brain penetrant anthelmintic drug, mebendazole, has shown promise as an anticancer agent in rodent models of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma.s The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) effect on colony formation, cell proliferation, and caspase-3/7 markers of apoptosis of mebendazole with and without radiation was measured in vitro. Mice intracranially implanted with KT21MG1 human meningioma were administered mebendazole alone or in combination with radiation. Survival benefit was evaluated, while tumors were investigated by immunohistochemical staining for apoptosis, cell proliferation, and vascular density. In vitro experiments on meningioma cell lines showed the IC50 for mebendazole in the range of 0.26-0.42 mu M. Mebendazole alone induced cytotoxicity, however the combination had a greater reduction in colony formation and resulted in higher levels of cleaved caspase-3. The in vivo study showed both, mebendazole alone and the combination, to have a survival benefit with an increase in apoptosis, and decreases in tumor cell and vascular proliferation. These preclinical findings indicate that mebendazole alone or in combination with radiation can be considered for the treatment of malignant meningioma. The mechanism of action for this combination may include an increase in apoptosis, a reduction in proliferation and angiogenesis, or a combination of these effects.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-018-03009-7.pdf
4715,Signal Transduction Inhibitors and Antiangiogenic Therapies for Malignant Glioma,"There is compelling evidence that activating mutations in members of signal transduction pathways can render cancer cells vulnerable to inhibitors of the mutant protein. Cancer types that have shown such extraordinary ''oncogene dependence'' include BCR-ABL mutant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)  , c-KIT mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)   , EGFR mutant nonsmall cell lung cancers   , and-most recently-BRAF mutant melanomas  . Signal transduction inhibitors have also been explored in patients with malignant glioma, but the results have been largely disappointing. The only agent that has shown consistent, albeit modest, activity in glioblastoma (GBM) is an antibody that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this chapter, we will review the current experience with inhibitors of growth factor signaling pathways in malignant glioma and discuss new approaches for the future development of these compounds.","Detailed characterization of the cancer genome in a large number of primary human glioblastomas has identified recurrent alterations that result in deregulation of signal transduction pathways and are ""druggable"" with a growing number of small molecule pharmaceuticals. While many of these compounds have shown clinical activity in other human cancers harboring similar genetic alterations, the clinical experience in glioblastoma has been disappointing thus far with only rare and transient radiographic responses. Our understanding of drug resistance is confounded by the uncertainty of drug delivery across the blood brain barrier and the limited knowledge to what extent the growth of these tumors depends on any particular signaling pathway. This uncertainty is, at least in part, due to shortcomings in the current approach to evaluate signal transduction inhibitors in glioma patients, including drug testing in molecularly unselected patient populations, limited documentation of drug penetration and target inhibition in tumor tissue, and use of radiographic response criteria that may not be optimal for the evaluation of these compounds.

4733,Selective MET Kinase Inhibition in MET-Dependent Glioma Models Alters Gene Expression and Induces Tumor Plasticity,"Therapy for high-grade diffuse gliomas (glioblastomas) consists of surgery followed by radiochemotherapy, but unfortunately these treatments only prolong median survival of patients to 15 months after first diagnosis  . A high percentage of glioblastomas carry genetic alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as EGFR, PDGFRa, and MET    . Constitutive activation of these RTKs contributes to oncogenic signaling, identifying these proteins as therapeutic targets. Of special interest as a tumor target in diffuse glioma is MET and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Whereas normal MET function is essential for wound healing, embryogenesis and organogenesis      , MET dysregulation is associated with tumorigenesis and in glioblastomas is linked to cellular growth and migration, shorter patient survival time, and poor treatment response        .","The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) MET represents a promising tumor target in a subset of glioblastomas. Most RTK inhibitors available in the clinic today, including those inhibiting MET, affect multiple targets simultaneously. Previously, it was demonstrated that treatment with cabozantinib (MET/VEGFR2/RET inhibitor) prolonged survival of mice carrying orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of the MET-addicted glioblastoma model E98, yet did not prevent development of recurrent and cabozantinib-resistant tumors. To exclude VEGFR2 inhibition-inflicted blood-brain barrier normalization and diminished tumor distribution of the drug, we have now investigated the effects of the novel MET-selective inhibitor Compound A in the orthotopic E98 xenograft model. In vitro, Compound A proved a highly potent inhibitor of proliferation of MET-addicted cell lines. In line with its target selectivity, Compound A did not restore the leaky blood-brain barrier and was more effective than cabozantinib in inhibiting MET phosphorylation in vivo. Compound A treatment significantly prolonged survival of mice carrying E98 tumor xenografts, but did not prevent eventual progression. Contrasting in vitro results, the Compound A-treated xenografts displayed high levels of AKT phosphorylation despite the absence of phosphorylated MET. Profiling by RNA sequencing showed that in vivo transcriptomes differed significantly from those in control xenografts.

4773,Recent Advances in Oncolytic Virotherapy and Immunotherapy for Glioblastoma A Glimmer of Hope in the Search for an Effective Therapy?,"Despite aggressive multimodal therapy (surgery, radiation, a genotoxic drug temozolomide, steroid dexamethasone, TTFields, lomustine, bevacizumab, re-irradiation, etc.), survival of adult patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma (grade IV malignant glioma) is usually less than 18-20 months    and 8-12 months     , respectively. Over the last decade, high expectations were placed on targeted drug therapy, which was hoped to provide tumor growth control and further improvement in survival rates. However, to date, no molecularly targeted drug/antibody or combinations of small molecule inhibitors have been demonstrated to be more efficient than temozolomide (TMZ) or to increase efficacy of standard therapy in patients with primary/recurrent glioblastoma. A high rate of failures in clinical trials ( Figure 1 ) and a lack of effective targeted therapy on the horizon have fostered the development of conceptually distinct therapeutic approaches such as cellular/peptide immunotherapy and oncolytic virotherapy. Next-generation immunotherapeutics and replication-competent genetically engineered oncolytic viruses demonstrated high efficacy in preclinical models (e.g.,      ). Recent early phase trials with the recombinant adenovirus DNX-2401 (Ad5-delta24-RGD)  , polio-rhinovirus chimera (PVSRIPO)  , parvovirus H-1 (ParvOryx)  , Toca 511 retroviral vector with 5-fluorocytosine  , heat shock protein-peptide complex-96 (HSPPC-  vaccine   , cytomegalovirus pp65 RNA-pulsed dendritic cells   , and a large phase III trial of an autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine (DCVax-L)  , have demonstrated that subsets of recurrent glioblastoma/glioma patients may significantly benefit from oncolytic virotherapy or dendritic cell-/peptide-based vaccines and survive >3 years after treatment. These encouraging clinical data raise a glimmer of hope in fighting glioblastoma after many years of intensive search for a cure.","To date, no targeted drugs, antibodies or combinations of chemotherapeutics have been demonstrated to be more efficient than temozolomide, or to increase efficacy of standard therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, temozolomide, steroid dexamethasone). According to recent phase III trials, standard therapy may ensure a median overall survival of up to 18-20 months for adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. These data explain a failure of positive non-controlled phase II trials to predict positive phase III trials and should result in revision of the landmark Stupp trial as a historical control for median overall survival in non-controlled trials. A high rate of failures in clinical trials and a lack of effective chemotherapy on the horizon fostered the development of conceptually distinct therapeutic approaches dendritic cell/peptide immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and oncolytic virotherapy. Recent early phase trials with the recombinant adenovirus DNX-2401 (Ad5-delta24-RGD), polio-rhinovirus chimera (PVSRIPO), parvovirus H-1 (ParvOryx), Toca 511 retroviral vector with 5-fluorocytosine, heat shock protein-peptide complex-96 (HSPPC-96) and dendritic cell vaccines, including DCVax-L vaccine, demonstrated that subsets of patients with glioblastoma/glioma may benefit from oncolytic virotherapy/immunotherapy (>3 years of survival after treatment). However, large controlled trials are required to prove efficacy of next-generation immunotherapeutics and oncolytic vectors.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/cancers/cancers-10-00492/article_deploy/cancers-10-00492.pdf
4797,Targeted therapy for high-grade glioma with the TGF-beta 2 inhibitor trabedersen results of a randomized and controlled phase IIb study,"T he high-grade gliomas, mainly anaplastic astrocytoma (AA; WHO grade III) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade IV), represent about 0% of all primary malignant brain tumors. Prognosis in these cases has only marginally improved despite technical advances in neurosurgery and radiotherapy and the approval of novel anticancer agents. Chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) has shown a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit in patients with newly diagnosed GBM with a median survival of 4. months with a combination of radiotherapy and TMZ vs . months with radiotherapy alone.  The respective 5-year survival rates were .8% vs .%.  However, overall survival (OS) is still poor, especially in patients with recurrent or refractory tumors with a median survival of . months for patients with AA and 7.4 months for patients with GBM.  The transforming growth factor  (TGF-b) is overexpressed in more than 0% of high-grade gliomas, and its levels are closely related to tumor progression.    Inhibition of TGF-b in tumor tissue leads to reversal of tumor-induced immune suppression as well as inhibition of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis.    Trabedersen (AP 00) is a synthetic antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the mRNA of the human TGF-b gene, developed as a novel, targeted treatment for patients with high-grade glioma. 0 The safety and efficacy of trabedersen has been established through various pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies, both in vitro and in vivo. In  phase I/II dose escalation studies, adult patients with recurrent or refractory AA or GBM and evidence of tumor progression were treated with trabedersen.  The maximum tolerated dose was not reached despite up to a 4-fold increase in the administered concentration. Long-lasting complete remissions were observed at doses of 0 and 80 mM trabedersen.","This randomized, open-label, active-controlled, dose-finding phase fib study evaluated the efficacy and safety of trabedersen (AP 12009) administered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with recurrent/refractory high-grade glioma. One hundred and forty-five patients with central reference histopathology of recurrent/refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) were randomly assigned to receive trabedersen at doses of 10 or 80 mu M or standard chemotherapy (temozolomide or procarbazine/lomustine/ vincristine). Primary endpoint was 6-month tumor control rate, and secondary endpoints included response at further timepoints, survival, and safety. Six-month tumor control rates were not significantly different in the entire study population (AA and GBM). Prespecified AA subgroup analysis showed a significant benefit regarding the 14-month tumor control rate for 10 mu M trabedersen vs chemotherapy (p=.0032). The 2-year survival rate had a trend for superiority for 10 mu M trabedersen vs chemotherapy (p=.10). Median survival for 10 mu M trabedersen was 39.1 months compared with 35.2 months for 80 mu M trabedersen and 21.7 months for chemotherapy (not significant). In GBM patients, response and survival results were comparable among the 3 arms. Exploratory analysis on GBM patients aged <= 55 years with Karnofsky performance status >80% at baseline indicated a 3-fold survival at 2 and 3 years for 10 mu M trabedersen vs chemotherapy. The frequency of patients with related or possibly drug-related adverse events was higher with standard chemotherapy (64%) than with 80 mu M trabedersen (43%) and 10 mu M trabedersen (27%). Superior efficacy and safety for 10 mu M trabedersen over 80 mu M trabedersen and chemotherapy and positive risk-benefit assessment suggest it as the optimal dose for further clinical development in high-grade glioma.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018908/pdf/noq142.pdf
4832,Temozolomide promotes immune escape of GBM cells via upregulating PD-L1,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Patients with GBM have traditionally been thought to have terrible prognosis, despite multiple therapies such as surgical resection combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ). Due to growth feature of GBM cells, it is difficult to remove tumor tissue completely through surgery. Surgery concomitant radio-and chemotherapy increased median survival time of the patients to 12-15 months, while 5-year survival rate is still less than 5%  . Thus, how to improve the treat-ment outcome in GBM is one of the biggest therapeutic challenges of the modern medicine  .","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor with poor prognosis, and currently effective therapeutic strategies are still limited. Although temozolomide (TMZ) is commonly used for GBM therapy and its mechanism was well characterized, while its side effects were required comprehensive investigation. In the present study, we revealed that TMZ-challenged GBM cells strongly suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in activated periphery blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which depended on enhanced transcription of CD274 (encoding PD-L1), but not other immune checkpoints, such as CD276, HVEM and galectin-9. Moreover, abundance of membranous PD-L1 was also increased in TMZ-treated GBM cells. When PD-L1 expression was knocked down by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), inhibitory effect of TMZ-treated GBM cells on PBMC became weakened, suggesting that PD-L1 was crucial for immune inhibition capacity of TMZ-treated GBM cells. Additionally, actinomycin D reduced PD-L1 expression in GBM cells after TMZ challenge, indicating that PD-L1 induction occurred at transcriptional level. The immunoblotting results demonstrated that STAT3 signaling was involved in TMZ-mediated PD-L1 induction, and attenuated expression of PD-L1 was observed using STAT3 inhibitor VI or STAT3 shRNA. Finally, the animal study showed that combination of TMZ and PD-1 antibody therapy strongly inhibited tumor growth and achieved the improved survival rate of GBM mice. Accordingly, this study revealed the classical chemotherapy drug TMZ promoted GBM cells immune escape, even TMZ combine with PD-1 antibody treatment not further improve survival ratio of recurrent GBM patients compared with traditional therapy methods, while our animal study provided evidence that combination of TMZ and PD-1 antibody was a promising way to treat GBM, these contradictory results indicate improving the PD-1 antibody delivery efficiency can exert strong combinational therapy outcomes.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6610056/pdf/ajcr0009-1161.pdf
4855,Micellar formulations of Crizotinib and Dasatinib in the management of glioblastoma multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumour, responsible for approximately 50% of all primary gliomas in adults   . GBM is usually managed with chemotherapeutic drugs, radiotherapy and interventional surgery  . Despite advancements in diagnostic technologies, surgical techniques, treatment regimens and radiotherapy applications, GBM carries poor prognosis when compared to other primary brain tumours  . Complete surgical resection, defined by the absence of contrast enhancement in post-operative magnetic resonance imaging is possible in only 13-25% of cases. Radiotherapy is also restricted by the intolerance of neighbouring healthy neural tissues. Moreover, the widely used chemotherapeutic agent in GBM, temozolomide can confer an average survival advantage of 2.5 months when combined with radiotherapy and complete surgical resection [   .","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) defies the currently practiced management of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery and hence, it is associated with a high fatality rate with a median survival of 14.6 months. In our previous work investigating different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), we established that a combination of Crizotinib and Dasatinib exerted the most potent effect on different GBM cell lines. In this work, to improve targeted therapy at the site of the tumour and avoid systemic toxicity, we exploited the enhanced permeability and retention effect by designing micellar formulations of these two TKIs. Crizotinib and Dasatinib were successfully encapsulated in poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) (SMA) micelles which were then evaluated for their physicochemical characteristics, anti-proliferative effect, mode of cell death, efficacy in spheroid models, effect on cell signalling, antiangiogenic potential and in vivo anticancer activity. Our results showed that this combination had induced a potent anti-proliferative effect in four GBM cell lines grown as a monolayer and as a spheroid. The combination was also efficacious in in vitro models of angiogenesis and vascular mimicry. In vivo data showed the enhanced activity of the micellar TKIs compared to free drugs. In conclusion, we proved that micellar formulations of Crizotinib and Dasatinib carry promising in vitro and in vivo efficacy that warrant further investigation.",https//www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1061186X.2017.1419357?needAccess=true
4903,Gene Therapy with Vector-producing Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells,"A. Gene-modiˆed MSCs Although gene-modiˆed MSCs have tumor-seeking property, local expression of the therapeutic protein is up to the presence of the MSCs. B. Vector-producing MSCs Progeny virus produced by the MSCs can transduce target cells in situ to amplify the therapeutic genes, which would be followed by long-term extensive expression, even when MSCs fade away. ","Suicide gene therapy with retroviral vector-producing cells was feasible as an adjuvant to the surgical resection of recurrent glioblastoma, although any benefit appeared to be marginal. Further evaluation of the therapeutic strategy with the vector-producing cells must incorporate improved delivery of vectors and transgenes to the target cells. We have previously demonstrated the ability of vector-producing tumor cells engineered by the adenovirus-retrovirus hybrid vector to destroy satellite tumor cells, although therapeutic efficacy for aggressive tumor has to be further evaluated by the systemic delivery of the vector-producing cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) should be an effective delivery vehicle to seek out tumor cells in vivo and transport cancer-killing gene or immune products with minimal rejection reaction by the host. We developed vector-producing tumor-tracking cells to improve suicide cancer gene therapy. Nucleofection was attempted to deliver retrovirus vector components into rodent MSCs. Athymic nude mice with subcutaneous 9L glioma were received vector-producing MSCs through the left ventricular cavity. Optical bioluminescence imaging in vivo revealed accumulation of the MSCs into the subcutaneous 9L tumors but not Rat-1 transplants. Consequently, the vector-producing MSCs significantly enhanced pro-drug killing of glioma cells compared to MSCs without ability to generate progeny virus. Our study demonstrated the effective MSCs-mediated tumor transduction with progeny vector production to improve suicide gene therapy. Although therapeutic benefit in the various orthotopic or metastatic tumor models has to be further validated, this transduction strategy would eradicate evasive tumors in situ.",https//www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yakushi/130/11/130_11_1513/_pdf
4904,Betulinic Acid-Mediated Tuning of PERK/CHOP Signaling by Sp1 Inhibition as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy for Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, and it is characterized by an aggressive clinical course. The primary treatments for GBM are maximal surgical cytoreduction, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and antivascular endothelial-growth-factor-targeted therapy   . Temozolomide (TMZ) is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent. Its small size and lipophilic Figure 1 . Betulinic acid (BA) suppresses tumor growth and survival in both parental and temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant (R) glioblastoma (GBM) cells, but not normal astrocytes. Cells were treated with 20, (A) 40, (B) or 100 μM of BA for 2 days. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as vehicle control. After treatment, cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Data presented as means ± standard deviations (t-Test **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001; ns not significant).","Patients with glioblastoma are at high risk of local recurrences after initial treatment with standard therapy, and recurrent tumor cells appear to be resistant to first-line drug temozolomide. Thus, finding an effective second-line agent for treating primary and recurrent glioblastomas is critical. Betulinic acid (BA), a natural product of plant origin, can cross the blood-brain barrier. Here, we investigated the antitumor effects of BA on typical glioblastoma cell lines and primary glioblastoma cells from patients, as well as corresponding temozolomide-resistant cells. Our findings verified that BA significantly reduced growth in all examined cells. Furthermore, gene-expression array analysis showed that the unfolded-protein response was significantly affected by BA. Moreover, BA treatment increased activation of the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) apoptotic pathway, and reduced specificity protein 1 (Sp1) expression. However, Sp1 overexpression reversed the observed cell-growth inhibition and PERK/CHOP signaling activation induced by BA. Because temozolomide-resistant cells exhibited significantly increased Sp1 expression, we concluded that Sp1-mediated PERK/CHOP signaling inhibition protects glioblastoma against cancer therapies; hence, BA treatment targeting this pathway can be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy to overcome such chemoresistance and tumor relapse.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/cancers/cancers-12-00981/article_deploy/cancers-12-00981-v2.pdf

Corresponding axial slices of the brain 15 days (column A) and 4 days (column B) before and 3 days after IA blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD) and bevacizumab infusion (column C) demonstrate rapid growth of the enhancing mass before treatment. After the procedure the tumor mass decreased in size as well as the degree of enhancement and mass effect. Reduction of edema after treatment can be concluded from subsiding T1 hypointensity around the tumor, which is evident when comparing columns C and B.","Patients suffering from malignant brain tumors are burdened with a grim prognosis. The blood brain barrier is considered a primary obstacle in therapeutic drug delivery to the brain. Intra-arterial (IA) delivery of therapeutic agents following osmotic BBB opening has been attempted for years, but high variability has limited its widespread implementation. It has been recently shown in animal studies that MRI is superior to X-ray for guiding IA infusions, as it allows direct visualization of the brain parenchyma perfused and facilitates predictable drug targeting. Moreover, PET imaging has revealed that IA, not intravenous, delivery of bevacizumab results in brain accumulation, providing strong rationale for utilizing the IA route.

One reason for the minimal progress during this time is the lack of accurate preclinical models to represent the patient's tumor's in vivo environment, causing a disconnect in drug therapy effectiveness between the laboratory and clinic. While patient-derived xenografts (PDX's or xenolines) are excellent human tumor representations, they are not amenable to high throughput testing. Therefore, we developed a miniaturized xenoline system (microtumors) for drug testing. Nineteen GBM xenolines were profiled for global kinase (kinomic) activity revealing actionable kinase targets associated with intracranial tumor growth rate. Kinase inhibitors for these targets (WP1066, selumetinib, crizotinib, and cediranib) were selected for single and combination therapy using a fully human-derived three-dimensional (3D) microtumor model of GBM xenoline cells embedded in HuBiogel for subsequent molecular and phenotype assays. GBM microtumors closely resembled orthotopically-implanted tumors based on immunohistochemical analysis and displayed kinomic and morphological diversity. Drug response testing could be reproducibly performed in a 96-well format identifying several synergistic combinations. Our findings indicate that 3D microtumors can provide a suitable high-throughput model for combination drug testing.",https//www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26840-4.pdf

Radiation and temozolomide non-specifically target rapidly proliferating cells by causing DNA damage. An alternative therapeutic strategy is to target the specific molecular alterations upon which GBM cells are dependent on survival. Multiple signaling pathways are commonly aberrant in any given tumor, and targeting individual members is not sufficient to kill GBM cells    . For example, despite the high prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and mutation in GBM, EGFR inhibition with gefitinib or erlotinib did not improve patient outcomes    , although this may have been due to inadequate drug levels reaching tumor cells  . This disappointment with single agent targeted therapy has in turn led to an understanding that concomitant use of multiple targeted agents may be necessary to increase patient survival.","Targeting specific molecular alterations in glioblastoma (GBM) might more effectively kill tumor cells and increase survival. Vandetanib inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Sirolimus inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a member the phosphoinositide 3-Kinase signaling pathway. We sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of vandetanib combined with sirolimus. Twenty-two patients (14 men; 8 women) with recurrent GBM enrolled. Median age and KPS were 52.5 years and 90 %, respectively. Patients were naive to anti-VEGF and anti-EGF therapy and mTOR inhibitors, and not on CYP3A4-inducing drugs. Vandetanib and sirolimus were orally administered on a continuous daily dosing schedule in escalating dose cohorts. Ten patients enrolled in the dose escalation phase. Twelve more enrolled at the MTD to explore progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6) in a single arm, single stage phase II-type design. In total, 19 patients received at least one dose at the MTD, and 15 completed at least 1 cycle at MTD. MTD was 200 mg vandetanib plus 2 mg sirolimus. The DLT was elevated AST/SGOT.

A retrospective study on the incidence of glioma among the Indian population done in the year 2017 documented that the incidence of patients with CNS tumors has been increasing over the last decades with poor prognosis in spite of constant studies being carried out. They also stated that GBM is commonly found in the sixth decade of life in a ratio of 2.61 among men and women, with a median survival rate of 8 months from initial diagnosis  .","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and malignant form of adult brain tumor with a high mortality rate and dismal prognosis. The present standard treatment comprising surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy using temozolomide can broaden patient's survival to some extent. However, the advantages are not palliative due to the development of resistance to the drug and tumor recurrence following the multimodal treatment approaches due to both intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity of GBM. One of the major contributors to temozolomide resistance is O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. Furthermore, deficiency of mismatch repair, base excision repair, and cytoprotective autophagy adds to temozolomide obstruction. Rising proof additionally showed that a small population of cells displaying certain stem cell markers, known as glioma stem cells, adds on to the resistance and tumor progression. Collectively, these findings necessitate the discovery of novel therapeutic avenues for treating glioblastoma. As of late, after understanding the pathophysiology and biology of GBM, some novel therapeutic discoveries, such as drug repurposing, targeted molecules, immunotherapies, antimitotic therapies, and microRNAs, have been developed as new potential treatments for glioblastoma. To help illustrate, ""what are the mechanisms of resistance to temozolomide"" and ""what kind of alternative therapeutics can be suggested"" with this fatal disease, a detailed history of these has been discussed in this review article, all with a hope to develop an effective treatment strategy for GBM.",https//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/cbin.11484?download=true
5125,Targeting metabolic transformation for cancer therapy,"Tumour cells have a remarkably different metabolism from that of the tissues from which they are derived. They exhibit an altered metabolism that allows them to sustain higher proliferative rates  2 and resist some cell death signals, particularly those mediated by increased oxidative damage 3 . However, this means that they are more nutrient hungry and excrete more waste products than normal tissues, resulting in a build-up of metabolites inside the cell and the formation of a more hostile environment outside the cell. In order to divide, a cell needs to both increase its size and replicate its DNA -processes that are hugely metabolically demanding and which require large quantities of proteins, lipids and nucleotides, as well as energy in the form of ATP. This anabolic drive requires cells to increase their uptake of the building blocks for this process, major factors being amino acids and glucose.","Cancer therapy has long relied on the rapid proliferation of tumour cells for effective treatment. However, the lack of specificity in this approach often leads to undesirable side effects. Many reports have described various 'metabolic transformation' events that enable cancer cells to survive, suggesting that metabolic pathways might be good targets. There are currently several drugs under development or in clinical trials that are based on specifically targeting the altered metabolic pathways of tumours. This Review highlights pathways against which there are already drugs in different stages of development and also discusses additional druggable targets.",https//www.nature.com/articles/nrc2817.pdf

The therapeutic challenge is partially a result of diffuse tumor infiltration into surrounding brain tissue having an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). Along with the development of novel antineoplastic therapies with improved tumor specificity, innovative ways of delivering these agents to the brain tumor are also under investigation.","OBJECTIVE We report the safety and feasibility of using convection-enhanced delivery to administer Cotara (Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tustin, CA), a novel radio-immunotherapeutic agent, to patients with malignant glioma.METHODS Between April 1998 and November 2002, 51 patients with histologically confirmed malignant glioma received Cotara by convection-enhanced delivery. Most patients (88%) were treated with Cotara targeting tumor volume-dependent, single or multiple administrations of activity ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 mCi/cm(3) of baseline clinical target volume. Two weeks after infusion, single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging determined the spatial distribution of Cotara. Patients were followed for as long as 41 months (average follow-up, 5 mo). Safety was evaluated on the basis of incidence of procedure-related, neurological, and systemic adverse events. Feasibility was evaluated in a subset of patients on the basis of the correlation between the prescribed activity and the actual activity administered to the targeted region.RESULTS Fifty-one patients, 37 with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, 8 with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, and 6 with recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas, were treated. Average tumor volume was 36 +/- 27.6 cm(3) (range, 5-168 cm(3)). Of the 67 infusions, 13 (19%), 52 (78%), and 2 (3%) delivered less than 90%, 100 +/- 10%, and more than 110%, respectively, of the prescribed administered activity to the targeted region. Treatment-emergent, drug-related central nervous system adverse events included brain edema (16%), hemiparesis (14%), and headache (14%). Systemic adverse events were mild.

Even with treatment, the median survival time of glioblastoma patients following diagnosis is 12~15 months   . Alkylating agent, temozolomide (TMZ), is currently the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of glioblastoma. The therapeutic action of TMZ is exerted by triggering DNA damage, which induces GBM cell apoptosis and senescence  . However, even with adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy, the 2-year overall survival rate of GBM patients only reaches~27%    . The therapeutic efficacy of TMZ depends on self-repair of DNA damage  , the rescue effect from RTK signaling    , and cell remodeling in the microenvironment [1 .","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant central nervous system tumor. Alkylating agent, temozolomide (TMZ), is currently the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for GBM. However, the sensitivity of GBM cells to TMZ is affected by many factors. And, several clinic trials, including co-administration of TMZ with other drugs, have failed in successful treatment of GBM. We have previously reported that Netrin-4 (NTN4), a laminin-like axon guidance protein, plays a protective role in GBM cell senescence upon TMZ-triggered DNA damage. However, the master regulator of NTN4 needs further elucidation. Epidermal growth factor/Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF/EGFR) can modulate the expression of various extracellular matrix related molecules, and prevent DNA damage in GBM cells. In this study, we investigated the relationship between EGF/EGFR signaling and NTN4, and explored their effect on therapeutic efficacy in GBM cells upon TMZ treatment.sCo-expression analysis were performed by using the RNA sequencing data from NIH 934 cell lines and from single cell RNA sequencing data of GBM tumor. The co-expressing genes were used for GO enrichment and signaling pathway enrichment. mRNA expression of the target genes were quantified by qPCR, and cell senescence were investigated by Senescence-Associated Beta-Galactosidase Staining. Protein phosphorylation were observed and analyzed by immunoblotting. The RNA sequencing data and clinical information of TMZ treated patients were extracted from TCGA-glioblastoma project, and then used for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Analysis of RNA sequencing data revealed a potential co-expression relationship between NTN4 and EGFR. GO enrichment of EGFR-correlated genes indicated that EGFR regulates GBM cells in a manner similar to that in central nervous system development and neural cell differentiation. Pathway analysis suggested that EGFR and its related genes contribute to cell adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and caspase related signaling. We also show that EGF stimulates NTN4 expression in GBM cells and cooperates with NTN4 to attenuate GBM cell senescence induced by DNA damage, possibly via AKT and ERK. Clinical analysis showed that co-expression of EGFR and NTN4 significantly predicts poor survival in TMZ-treated GBM patients.This study indicates that EGF/EGFR regulates and cooperates with NTN4 in DNA damage resistance in GBM. Therefore, our findings provide a potential therapeutic target for GBM.",https//bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12885-018-5056-4.pdf
5241,Cytomegalovirus infection induces a stem cell phenotype in human primary glioblastoma cells prognostic significance and biological impact,"GBM is the most prevalent and the most aggressive primary malignancy of the central nervous system in adults. It is a highly vascularized and infiltrating tumor, rarely cured and prone to recurrence. The median duration of survival after diagnosis is less than 15 months, despite aggressive therapy consisting of surgical resection and concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. 1 Surgical resection of GBMs is typically incomplete, as they are located in the brain and are highly infiltrative. Postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy fail to eradicate all remaining GBM cells. Thus, a breakthrough in identifying a new treatment option leading to a cure of this disease is still lacking.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is associated with poor prognosis despite aggressive surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Unfortunately, this standard therapy does not target glioma cancer stem cells (GCSCs), a subpopulation of GBM cells that can give rise to recurrent tumors. GBMs express human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) proteins, and previously we found that the level of expression of HCMV immediate-early (IE) protein in GBMs is a prognostic factor for poor patient survival. In this study, we investigated the relation between HCMV infection of GBM cells and the presence of GCSCs. Primary GBMs were characterized by their expression of HCMV-IE and GCSCs marker CD133 and by patient survival. The extent to which HCMV infection of primary GBM cells induced a GCSC phenotype was evaluated in vitro. In primary GBMs, a large fraction of CD133-positive cells expressed HCMV-IE, and higher co-expression of these two proteins predicted poor patient survival. Infection of GBM cells with HCMV led to upregulation of CD133 and other GSCS markers (Notch1, Sox2, Oct4, Nestin). HCMV infection also promoted the growth of GBM cells as neurospheres, a behavior typically displayed by GCSCs, and this phenotype was prevented by either chemical inhibition of the Notch1 pathway or by treatment with the anti-viral drug ganciclovir. GBM cells that maintained expression of HCMV-IE failed to differentiate into neuronal or astrocytic phenotypes. Our findings imply that HCMV infection induces phenotypic plasticity of GBM cells to promote GCSC features and may thereby increase the aggressiveness of this tumor.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4716305/pdf/cdd201591a.pdf
5264,"Co-administration of ABT-737 and SAHA induces apoptosis, mediated by Noxa upregulation, Bax activation and mitochondrial dysfunction in PTEN-intact malignant human glioma cell lines","Malignant glioma is an aggressive brain tumor that responds poorly to conventional treatment modalities   . The underlying molecular basis for resistance to apoptosis is not understood   but recent discoveries as to the pathogenesis of glioblastoma have led to the development of rationally-designed, targeted therapies aimed at disrupting key signaling pathways. Single agent therapy has proven ineffective in treatment of glioblastoma, likely due to the fact that gliomas demonstrate multiple modes of resistance, including co-activation of multiple tyrosine kinases and redundancy in pro-survival signaling pathways. Recently, high-throughput RNA-interference screens have identified logical targets for combinatorial therapy in glioma and have shown that silencing of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members could reduce cell viability   .","We previously observed that glioma cells are differentially sensitive to ABT-737 and, when used as a single-agent, this drug failed to induce apoptosis. Identification of therapeutic strategies to enhance the efficacy of the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 in human glioma is of interest. Histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDACI) are currently being assessed clinically in patients with glioma, as regulation of epigenetic abnormalities is expected to produce pro-apoptotic effects. We hypothesized that co-treatment of glioma with a BH3-mimetic and HDACI may induce cellular death. We assessed the combination of ABT-737 and HDACI SAHA in established and primary cultured glioma cells. We found combination treatment led to significant cellular death when compared to either drug as single agent and demonstrated activation of the caspase cascade. This enhanced apoptosis also appears dependent upon the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c and AIF into the cytosol. The upregulation of Noxa, truncation of Bid, and activation of Bax caused by this combination were important factors for cell death and the increased levels of Noxa functioned to sequester Mcl-1. This combination was less effective in PTEN-deficient glioma cells. Both genetic and pharmacologic inactivation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway sensitized PTENdeleted glioma cells to the combination. This study demonstrates that antagonizing apoptosis-resistance pathways, such as targeting the Bcl-2 family in combination with epigenetic modifiers, may induce cell death. These findings extend our previous observations that targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway may be additionally necessary to promote apoptosis in cancers lacking PTEN functionality.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-014-1575-2.pdf
5293,Tamoxifen modulation of etoposide cytotoxicity involves inhibition of protein kinase C activity and insulin-like growth factor II expression in brain tumor cells,"Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) represent the second most common form of malignancy in children after leukemia. In the United States approximately 2000 children below the age of 15 years are diagnosed yearly with CNS tumors at an incidence of 25-30 cases per million children   . The treatment of pediatric brain tumors has historically consisted of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy when indicated. In the past decade however, chemotherapy has proven to be of value not only in producing durable responses in some aggressive brain tumors, but more importantly improved survival rates  .","Tamoxifen, a non-steroidal anti-estrogen widely used against breast cancer, is also useful for treatment of other malignancies, due to its sensitizing effect on other chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. We have investigated the advantages of combining tamoxifen with one of the commonly used cancer chemotherapeutic drug, etoposide (VP-16) in brain tumor cell lines. While tamoxifen (10 muM) increased etoposide cytotoxicity 8.3-fold in the human glioma cell line (HTB-14), it increased etoposide cytotoxicity 47.5- and 40-fold in two primary cell lines established from pediatric medulloblastoma patients (MCH-BT-31 and MCH-BT-39), respectively. Similarly, in the pediatric ependymoma cell lines (MCH-BT-30 and MCH-BT-52), tamoxifen enhanced etoposide cytotoxicity 6- and 2.68-fold, respectively. CalcuSyn analysis of cytotoxicity data showed that tamoxifen and etoposide combinations were synergistic with combination index values ranging from 0.243 to 0.369 at IC50 level among different pediatric brain tumor cell lines. Tamoxifen is also cytotoxic at higher concentrations (>20 muM) in brain tumor cells. To understand the mechanism underlying the tamoxifen modulation of etoposide cytotoxicity, we analyzed expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), IGF-I, IGF-II and estrogen receptor as well as protein kinase C (PKC) activity. While P-gp, IGF-IR and IGF-I were not affected, enhanced inhibition of PKC, and IGF-II were observed in brain tumor cells treated with tamoxifen and etoposide combination as compared to cells treated with either drug alone. Tamoxifen at 10 muM when combined with etoposide at 0-100 muM concentrations reduced PKC activity 77% compared to only 58% without tamoxifen. IGF-II expression decreased to 48.6% of the untreated control in the combination treatment as compared to 31.2% for etoposide alone and 26.2% for tamoxifen alone treatments. These results suggest that inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on brain tumor cells manifest through different mechanisms involving inhibition of targets such as PKC and IGF-II.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/BNEON.0000021738.77612.1b.pdf
5313,BKM120 sensitizes C6 glioma cells to temozolomide via suppression of the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B/MGMT signaling pathway,"Glioblastoma is one of the most common types of malignant tumors and exhibits a poor prognosis  . Due to the high invasiveness and heterogeneity, glioma has been demonstrated to exhibit resistance to traditional treatment, including surgery, irradiation and chemotherapy  . The average survival time for patients with glioblastoma has marginally changed over the previous years and remains at ~8-12 months  . Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to develop novel therapy strategies in order to treat this malignant neoplasm.","Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant intracranial tumor in adults. Temozolomide (TMZ), as the first-line chemotherapy agent used in patients with glioblastoma, has demonstrated different effects in patients due to the expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) which is able to repair the DNA lesions induced by TMZ. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is over-activated in glioblastoma and has been revealed to be potentially implicated in resistance to TMZ. BKM120, a selective pan class I PI3K inhibitor, has been reported to facilitate apoptosis and reverse drug resistance in advanced solid tumors. The present study aims to investigate whether BKM120 is able to sensitize glioma cells to TMZ. C6 glioma cells were treated with BKM120 and/or TMZ for 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays were performed to determine cell viability. The level of apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33342 and TUNEL staining, and the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2-like protein 4 (Bax) expression was measured. Furthermore, the present study investigated the possible mechanism underlying BKM120 reverse chemoresistance to TMZ. The downstream targets of PI3K, including phosphorylated (p)-Akt, nuclear factor (NF)-B p65, were analyzed by western blotting. The MGMT transcription levels in monotherapy and combination therapy were demonstrated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The present study revealed that monotherapy treatments with either drug required a high concentration found reduction in cell viability. However, a low concentration of BKM120 inhibited the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B signaling pathway activity in glioma cells and significantly increased TMZ cytotoxicity. The coefficient of drug interaction was similar to 0.7.  from the TUNEL assay, Hoechst 33342 staining and evaluation of the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax expression also confirmed the finding that the combination treatment induced a higher level of apoptosis compared with the TMZ monotherapy. RT-qPCR demonstrated that the combination strategy reversed the TMZ-induced MGMT over-transcription. The reduction of NF-kappa B p65 in combination treatment supported the hypothesis that BKM120 may mediate MGMT transcription via inhibition of NF-kappa B p65. In conclusion, BKM120 and TMZ demonstrated strong synergistic cytotoxicity in C6 glioma cells. The BKM120-induced NF-kappa B p65 inhibition may be involved in the mediation of MGMT transcription to reverse TMZ-resistance in C6 glioma cells.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5680702/pdf/ol-14-06-6597.pdf
5336,Randomized Controlled Immunotherapy Clinical Trials for GBM Challenged,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death, accounting for about 1 in 6 human deaths. Worldwide, in 2018, about 9.6 million deaths were due to cancer  . Between 2013 and 2017, the cancer death rate (mortality rate) in the US was 158/100,000 individuals per year. The rate of new cases (incidence) in a similar period was 442/100,000 individuals per year  . Intensive preclinical and clinical research is being performed to find solutions. In some domains, like pediatric hemato-oncology, major progress has been realized towards a cure through systematic randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). In each trial, a new experimental arm is assessed versus the best current treatment as the control arm   , in combination with careful monitoring of (long-term) side effects  ."," Although multiple meta-analyses on active specific immunotherapy treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have demonstrated a significant prolongation of overall survival, no single research group has succeeded in demonstrating the efficacy of this type of treatment in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. In this paper, we explain how the complexity of the tumor biology and tumor-host interactions make proper stratification of a control group impossible. The individualized characteristics of advanced therapy medicinal products for immunotherapy contribute to heterogeneity within an experimental group. The dynamics of each tumor and in each patient aggravate comparative stable patient groups. Finally, combinations of immunotherapy strategies should be integrated with first-line treatment. We illustrate the complexity of a combined first-line treatment with individualized multimodal immunotherapy in a group of 70 adults with GBM and demonstrate that the integration of immunogenic cell death treatment within maintenance chemotherapy followed by dendritic cell vaccines and maintenance immunotherapy might provide a step towards improving the overall survival rate of GBM patients.Immunotherapies represent a promising strategy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment. Different immunotherapies include the use of checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and vaccines such as dendritic cell vaccines. Antibodies have also been used as toxin or radioactive particle delivery vehicles to eliminate target cells in the treatment of GBM. Oncolytic viral therapy and other immunogenic cell death-inducing treatments bridge the antitumor strategy with immunization and installation of immune control over the disease. These strategies should be included in the standard treatment protocol for GBM. Some immunotherapies are individualized in terms of the medicinal product, the immune target, and the immune tumor-host contact. Current individualized immunotherapy strategies focus on combinations of approaches. Standardization appears to be impossible in the face of complex controlled trial designs. To define appropriate control groups, stratification according to the Recursive Partitioning Analysis classification, MGMT promotor methylation, epigenetic GBM sub-typing, tumor microenvironment, systemic immune functioning before and after radiochemotherapy, and the need for/type of symptom-relieving drugs is required. Moreover, maintenance of a fixed treatment protocol for a dynamic, deadly cancer disease in a permanently changing tumor-host immune context might be inappropriate. This complexity is illustrated using our own data on individualized multimodal immunotherapies for GBM. Individualized medicines, including multimodal immunotherapies, are a rational and optimal yet also flexible approach to induce long-term tumor control. However, innovative methods are needed to assess the efficacy of complex individualized treatments and implement them more quickly into the general health system.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/cancers/cancers-13-00032/article_deploy/cancers-13-00032.pdf
5377,c-Myc-miR-29c-REV3L signalling pathway drives the acquisition of temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common form of primary brain tumour in adults, has the highest mortality rate among all brain malignancies. This is primarily owing to its persistent tumour growth and highly aggressive invasion, as well as resistance to antitumour drug and ionizing radiation  . Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent currently used as first-line therapy for the treatment of GBM  . However, a major impediment to effective treatment is acquired resistance to TMZ. Although considerable attention has been focused on several key pathways that have been implicated in TMZ resistance, including elevated expression of the repair protein O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (encoded by MGMT), a deficiency in the mismatch repair pathway or an active base excision repair pathway   , there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of TMZ resistance and to identify novel mechanisms, biomarkers and therapeutic targets for predicting treatment response or preventing the emergence of therapy-resistant tumours.","Resistance to temozolomide poses a major clinical challenge in glioblastoma multiforme treatment, and the mechanisms underlying the development of temozolomide resistance remain poorly understood. Enhanced DNA repair and mutagenesis can allow tumour cells to survive, contributing to resistance and tumour recurrence. Here, using recurrent temozolomide-refractory glioblastoma specimens, temozolomide-resistant cells, and resistant-xenograft models, we report that loss of miR-29c via c-Myc drives the acquisition of temozolomide resistance through enhancement of REV3L-mediated DNA repair and mutagenesis in glioblastoma. Importantly, disruption of c-Myc/miR-29c/REV3L signalling may have dual anticancer effects, sensitizing the resistant tumours to therapy as well as preventing the emergence of acquired temozolomide resistance. Our findings suggest a rationale for targeting the c-Myc/miR-29c/REV3L signalling pathway as a promising therapeutic approach for glioblastoma, even in recurrent, treatment-refractory settings.",https//watermark.silverchair.com/awv287.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAArwwggK4BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKpMIICpQIBADCCAp4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMykT-Yc2UG1HlVZTAAgEQgIICb1f10nmzzuBHwJDteGq1IkRLGt_jVVyRSAUtK6QZ-jCZc6kw19UOFp62gv74LxEaVlAm_7vA2--PhttEVCov7wy9i875IEXjyqi7XtGvPgzErbZ7b5nZV6Y6ynUW4arRRCykqqYt6f0wV1mWCe9sgDstqvjPLnbZTOfj1F1v6KnceSZbytQlVIfOJ0MQFYJ-IRE9nZIb2_8oITjy3KUxAOQncWVpaQYAQ9QtqQE0bPjFYSV51bSsIr9fqU9z-iqwSnbok2XuFugR_OToAEjZWm-qnD3587OdThMNRLdrPtQOJdCh_BJHp1ViqD8RohsgXJNNRuy0SLWNYK--yCi1Yl4Smj4MsmWpjWJSSPa-v-1GyuQLLGX_DyayQsr8Sqb5Er5fp-47aLhSwJpUnw3GTSQELoEPwYLtiz1KemgcS0l-CIOeRVB_dce3CsJBZEBW8bnjsTlXp1oeBFCCi6sSxGGBrNnGCshroO-APuhMgAOR7FWIrfXJY1Suv94OjeYicJT5yR_zKEjLyLaOyZGLywrv8qLSxVbXiBcsdTmxs6Kf43I2J7pMPLNio-w4uK6zfVIRl816oygfqXuBtah0XpUDlEqRXSTL2fSHZTR6PIi7p1CzDFpBVsH9ysL6Ndg6xd6LUA_7Betk85NkRKhuB7gVxFcfxbHVX4G5IxUWYInKYZtCUMCg5FULivZVAZGXpmFK84FtStHmcEr50ZX-cje1T49Ll6GfIbvZkKSxNlaP3ytzKoPWljVwM0ZcTVWXpyDBqq0qJZjbb3jKldIOhS0DrOmNQ_lA7qoKH72aTtENrN1spUthaqERKnOMqy5Z
5432,PI3K-mTOR Pathway Inhibition Exhibits Efficacy Against High-grade Glioma in Clinically Relevant Mouse Models,"Glioblastomas (WHO Grade IV) are the most common primary brain tumors with a median survival of only 15 months, despite intensive treatment including surgery and chemoradiation. Common molecular alterations in glioblastoma include overexpression of EGFR, PDGFR, and cMET, activating mutations in PI3K and EGFR (EGFRvIII) and loss of function of PTEN by deletion or mutations (1, 2). These alterations lead to constitutive activation of PI3K and further downstream effectors such as mTOR, which are crucial for tumor cell growth, proliferation, and survival  . Preclinical studies suggest that inhibition of this pathway results in either direct inhibition of tumor growth or in sensitizing cells to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy   . Activation of the PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway is a very common event in solid tumors, which triggered the development of numerous small-molecule inhibitors. Although these PI3K inhibitors have been developed mainly for other more common solid tumors, they are now also being tested against glioblastoma (e.g., Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers NCT01339052, NCT00085566, NCT01240460, NCT02430363, NCT01316809)  . Unfortunately, however, the outcomes of clinical studies with agents that target the PI3K pathway in glioblastoma have been disappointing so far. The prototype mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (sirolimus) and its analogues (so called rapalogs) temsirolimus and everolimus were considered promising targeted agents for glioblastoma, but a number of phase I and II trials applying them either as monotherapy or in combination with an EGFR inhibitor failed to demonstrate meaningful clinical efficacy in recurrent glioblastoma   . Possible explanations for this lack of efficacy include a lack of mTORC2 inhibition by rapalogs  , increased upstream signaling of Akt through negative feedback loops following mTOR inhibition   , and PTEN status  . Although these events, which focus on PI3K-mTOR signaling itself, may have contributed to the failures, a frequently underappreciated but critical issue is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that may have hampered drug delivery to tumor cells in quantities required to elicit a meaningful pharmacologic response. Especially those glioblastoma cells that escaped surgical resection due to their migration away from the tumor core into adjacent regions of the brain will be shielded by a more intact BBB   ."," The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway is frequently activated in glioblastoma and offers several druggable targets. However, clinical efficacy of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in glioblastoma has not yet been demonstrated. Insufficient drug delivery may limit the efficacy of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors against glioblastoma. The presence of the efflux transporters ABCB1/Abcb1 (P-glycoprotein, MDR1) and ABCG2/Abcg2 (BCRP) at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the brain penetration of many drugs.Experimental Design We used in vitro drug transport assays and performed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies in wild-type and ABC-transporter knockout mice. The efficacy of PI3K-mTOR inhibition was established using orthotopic allograft and genetically engineered spontaneous glioblastoma mouse models. The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and AZD8055 are substrates of ABCB1, whereas the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 and the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 are not. Moreover, ABCG2 transports NVP-BEZ235 and AZD8055, but not ZSTK474 or rapamycin. Concordantly, Abcb1a/b(-/-); Abcg2(-/-) mice revealed increased brain penetration of rapamycin (13-fold), AZD8055 (7.7-fold), and NVP-BEZ235 (4.5-fold), but not ZSTK474 relative toWTmice. Importantly, ABCtransporters limited rapamycin brain penetration to subtherapeutic levels, while the reduction in NVP-BEZ235 brain penetration did not prevent target inhibition. NVP-BEZ235 and ZSTK474 demonstrated antitumor efficacy with improved survival against U87 orthotopic gliomas, although the effect of ZSTK474 was more pronounced. Finally, ZSTK474 prolonged overall survival in Cre-LoxP conditional transgenic Pten; p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf); K-Ras(v12); LucRmice, mainly by delaying tumor onset. PI3K/mTOR inhibitors with weak affinities for ABC transporters can achieve target inhibition in brain (tumors), but have modest single-agent efficacy and combinations with (BBB penetrable) inhibitors of other activated pathways may be required.

5474,Convection-Enhanced Delivery,"In spite of significant advances in surgery, imaging, and adjuvant therapy, the average prognosis for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is only about 13 months, with a 2-year survival rate of 27%, and a 5-year survival rate of 5.1%     . This poor prognosis can be attributed to a number of challenges historically related to treating neurological diseases. Chief amongst these challenges is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is largely responsible for the gap between scientific advances and improvement of outcomes for many neurological diseases      . In addition, many forms of delivery, including systemic delivery (intravenously or oral), are limited by the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier and by systemic toxicities   . These limitations make it difficult to achieve therapeutic concentrations of agents in targeted areas of the brain.","Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a promising technique that generates a pressure gradient at the tip of an infusion catheter to deliver therapeutics directly through the interstitial spaces of the central nervous system. It addresses and offers solutions to many limitations of conventional techniques, allowing for delivery past the blood-brain barrier in a targeted and safe manner that can achieve therapeutic drug concentrations. CED is a broadly applicable technique that can be used to deliver a variety of therapeutic compounds for a diversity of diseases, including malignant gliomas, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. While a number of technological advances have been made since its development in the early 1990s, clinical trials with CED have been largely unsuccessful, and have illuminated a number of parameters that still need to be addressed for successful clinical application. This review addresses the physical principles behind CED, limitations in the technique, as well as means to overcome these limitations, clinical trials that have been performed, and future developments.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5398992/pdf/13311_2017_Article_520.pdf
5513,EGFR(vIII) An Oncogene with Ambiguous Role,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1) is a member of a tyrosine kinase receptor family, also including ErbB2/HER2/Neu, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/ HER4  . All these receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins with a molecular mass ranging from 170 to 185 kDa  . Activation of ErbB receptor may be triggered by one of 13 ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), amphiregulin, betacellulin, epiregulin, neuregulin 1-6, heparinbinding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), or epigen, with the first five being EGFR-specific  . It is not clear how EGFR is activated and triggers a cascade of downstream signaling in cells. Generally, its activation involves ligand binding and subsequent receptor dimerization; however, it was also indicated that receptor may dimerize regardless of ligand presence   . Intriguingly, dimers formed in such a ligand-independent manner remain inactive till the ligand is finally bound  . Activation of EGF receptor may induce signal in Ras/Raf/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, or PLC/PKC pathways   , having an impact on a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, cell survival, or differentiation   . Termination of signaling cascade occurs after receptor internalization, mostly in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, leading to its trafficking into early endosomes. Further, receptor may be either transported back to the cell membrane or degraded in late endosomes and lysosomes  .","Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFR(vIII)) seems to constitute the perfect therapeutic target for glioblastoma (GB), as it is specifically present on up to 28-30% of GB cells. In case of other tumor types, expression and possible role of this oncogene still remain controversial. In spite of EGFR(vIII) mechanism of action being crucial for the design of small active anticancer molecules and immunotherapies, i.e., CAR-T technology, it is yet to be precisely defined. EGFR(vIII) is known to be resistant to degradation, but it is still unclear whether it heterodimerizes with EGF-activated wild-type EGFR (EGFR(WT)) or homodimerizes (including covalent homodimerization). Constitutive kinase activity of this mutated receptor is relatively low, and some researchers even claim that a nuclear, but not a membrane function, is crucial for its activity. Based on the analyses of recurrent tumors that are often lacking EGFR(vIII) expression despite its initial presence in corresponding primary foci, this oncogene is suggested to play a marginal role during later stages of carcinogenesis, while even in primary tumors EGFR(vIII) expression is detected only in a small percentage of tumor cells, undermining the rationality of EGFR(vIII)-targeting therapies. On the other hand, EGFR(vIII)-positive cells are resistant to apoptosis, more invasive, and characterized with enhanced proliferation rate. Moreover, expression of this oncogenic receptor was also postulated to be a marker of cancer stem cells. Opinions regarding the role that EGFR(vIII) plays in tumorigenesis and for tumor aggressiveness are clearly contradictory and, therefore, it is crucial not only to determine its mechanism of action, but also to unambiguously define its role at early and advanced cancer stages.",https//downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jo/2019/1092587.pdf

A first-in-human, phase I study was conducted in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.Patients and s GDC-0084 was administered orally, once daily, to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity. Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) was performed to measure metabolic responses. Forty-seven heavily pretreated patients enrolled in eight cohorts (2-65 mg). Dose-limiting toxicities included 1 case of grade 2 bradycardia and grade 3 myocardial ischemia (15 mg), grade 3 stomatitis (45 mg), and 2 cases of grade 3 mucosal inflammation (65 mg); the MTD was 45 mg/day. GDC-0084 demonstrated linear and dose-proportional PK, with a half-life (similar to 19 hours) supportive of once-daily dosing. At 45 mg/day, steady-state concentrations exceeded preclinical target concentrations producing antitumor activity in xenograft models. FDG-PET in 7 of 27 patients (26%) showed metabolic partial response. At doses >= 45 mg/day, a trend toward decreased median standardized uptake value in normal brain was observed, suggesting central nervous system penetration of drug. In two resection specimens, GDC-0084 was detected at similar levels in tumor and brain tissue, with a brain tissue/tumor-to-plasma ratio of >1 and >0.5 for total and free drug, respectively. Best overall response was stable disease in 19 patients (40%) and progressive disease in 26 patients (55%); 2 patients (4%) were nonevaluable. GDC-0084 demonstrated classic PI3K/mTOR-inhibitor related toxicities.

5593,Phase II study of CCI-779 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme,"Novel therapeutic strategies are needed for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), for whom the median survival is currently 4 to 6 months. Recent advances in the understanding of aberrant molecular and cytogenetic pathways involved in GBM pathogenesis and progression have led to the rational targeting of some of these pathways. A significant percentage of GBM have altered PTEN gene suppression activity  , which results in the increased activity of the phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. The PI3K/Akt pathway activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), increasing translation of a number of key proteins required for cell-cycle progression. The presence of PTEN gene alterations and the subsequent activation of these downstream pathways have been associated with poor prognosis in anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and GBM    . Restoration of PTEN function or targeting of the components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways can result in cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or reduced tumorigenicity and are rational targets for clinical evaluation."," Loss of PTEN, which is common in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), results in activation of the mammalian target of rapapmycin (mTOR), thereby increasing mRNA translation of a number of key proteins required for cell-cycle progression. CCI-779 is an inhibitor of mTOR. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of CCI-779 in patients with recurrent GBM and to further assess the toxicity of the drug. Experimental Design CCI-779 was administered weekly at a dose of 250 mg intravenously for patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs). Patients not on EIAEDs were initially treated at 250 mg; however, the dose was reduced to 170 mg because of intolerable side effects. Treatment was continued until unacceptable toxicity, tumor progression, or patient withdrawal. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival.  Forty-three patients were enrolled; 29 were not on EIAEDs. The expected toxicity profile of increased lipids, lymphopenia, and stomatitis was seen. There were no grade IV hematological toxicities and no toxic deaths. One patient was progression free at 6 months. Of the patients assessable for response, there were 2 partial responses and 20 with stabilization of disease. The median time to progression was 9 weeks.  CCI-779 was well tolerated at this dose schedule; however, there was no evidence of efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM. Despite initial disease stabilization in approximately 50% of patients, the durability of response was short. Because of the low toxicity profile, CCI-779 may merit exploration in combination with other modalities.",https//deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/45273/10637_2005_Article_1444.pdf?sequence=1
5608,A Potent Blood-Brain Barrier-Permeable Mutant IDH1 Inhibitor Suppresses the Growth of Glioblastoma with IDH1 Mutation in a Patient-Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Model,"Gliomas are the second most common primary brain tumors in adults and comprise three major histologic subtypes astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastomas (GBM). This classification is based on morphologic similarities to normal cellular counterparts.","Gliomas are the second most common primary brain tumors in adults. They are treated with combination therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. There are currently limited treatment options for recurrent gliomas, and new targeted therapies need to be identified, especially in glioblastomas, which have poor prognosis. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations are detected in various tumors, including gliomas. Most patients with IDH mutant glioma harbor the IDH1R132H subtype. Mutant IDH catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which induces aberrant epigenetic status and contributes to malignant progression, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target for IDH mutant tumors. The present study describes a novel, orally bioavailable selective mutant IDH1 inhibitor, DS-1001b. The drug has high blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and inhibits IDH1R132H. Continuous administration of DS-1001b impaired tumor growth and decreased 2-HG levels in subcutaneous and intracranial xenograft models derived from a patient with glioblastoma with IDH1 mutation. Moreover, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein was strongly induced by DS-1001b, suggesting that inhibition of mutant IDH1 promotes glial differentiation. These results reveal the efficacy of BBB-permeable DS-1001b in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models and provide a preclinical rationale for the clinical testing of DS-1001b in recurrent gliomas.",https//mct.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanther/19/2/375.full.pdf

Thus, new methods for GBM treatment are clearly needed.","Substantial progress has been made in the clinical application of molecularly targeted proteinaceous cytotoxins for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a primary brain tumor of dismal prognosis. These recombinant cytotoxins are composed of tumor-targeting ligands and genetically engineered derivatives of extremely toxic to eukaryotic cells bacterial toxins. Several cytotoxins moved relatively quickly, as for novel anti-cancer drugs, from bench to clinic during the last decade; both clinical studies and laboratory research have brought invaluable translational information. The important factors that are linked to the overall cytotoxins' clinical utility are target specificity, proportion of potential responders to a cytotoxin among patients and an efficient delivery of the cytotoxin directly to the tumor site using convection-enhanced delivery (CED). Novel, potent, and very specific cytotoxins against GBM are being continuously generated. Moreover, a combinatorial targeting of more than one target in GBM with the cytotoxins emerges as an approach of potentially higher anti-tumor efficacy and more universal usage. Novel means of recombinant cytotoxins delivery are being envisioned and tested. The next decade should bring more complete and Successful clinical application of recombinant cytotoxins, a highly promising class of anti-GBM drugs. Drug Dev Res 69407-414, 2008.

5649,An Overview of Fotemustine in High-Grade Gliomas From Single Agent to Association with Bevacizumab,"Fotemustine is a third-generation nitrosourea showing efficacy in melanoma, some haematological tumors, and gliomas. Malignant gliomas account for approximately 50% of all malignant primary brain tumors in adults; highgrade gliomas include anaplastic astrocytomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytomas, anaplastic ependymomas, and glioblastomas. Standard therapy for newly diagnosed malignant glioma includes surgical resection when feasible, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Presently, there is no consensus therapy recommended for the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas; a second debulking surgery could be proposed as well as a second course of chemotherapy. However, despite optimal treatment, median survival ranges from 12 to 15 months for glioblastoma and from 2 to 5 years for anaplastic gliomas  . Various antineoplastic agents such as temozolomide, procarbazine, carmustine, lomustine, and vincristine, or some combinations of those, were used. Numerous phase II studies showed an important activity of fotemustine in high-grade gliomas, especially in glioblastoma, as first-line treatment or in recurrent disease  .","Fotemustine is a third-generation nitrosourea showing efficacy in various types of tumors such as melanoma and glioma. We reviewed the most important studies on fotemustine treatment in glioma patients analyzing its pharmacological profile and its activity and safety. Fotemustine was used as single agent or in association with new targeted drugs such as bevacizumab; fotemustine was used both as first-line chemotherapy before temozolomide era and in refractory-temozolomide patients during temozolomide era. Finally, analyzing and comparing the activity and safety of fotemustine alone or in combination with bevacizumab versus other nitrosoureas such as lomustine, we may suggest that the combination treatment with bevacizumab and fotemustine may be active and tolerable in patients with high grade gliomas.",https//downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/698542.pdf
5671,Phase I/II study of erlotinib and temsirolimus for patients with recurrent malignant gliomas North American Brain Tumor Consortium trial 04-02,"High-grade gliomas are the most common type of brain tumor in adults.  Despite optimal therapy, patients with glioblastoma (GBM) have a median survival of only  -9 months, while those with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) have a median survival of - months. For patients with high-grade glioma whose tumors recur, the median time to tumor progression is only 9 - weeks.  There is a need for more effective therapies based on novel mechanisms of action. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is amplified and overexpressed in 0% -50% of GBM,  and nearly half of these tumors have a constitutively activated mutation known as EGFR variant (v)III.   Genomic alterations (deletions or mutations) of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) lead to protein loss or reduction in 0% -0% of GBM.  -0 These molecular abnormalities activate the pathways for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol -kinase (PIK)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), resulting in tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis.","Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) may have synergistic antitumor effects in high-grade glioma patients.We conducted a phase I/II study of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (150 mg/day) and the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. Patients initially received temsirolimus 50 mg weekly, and the dose adjusted based on toxicities. In the phase II component, the primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) among glioblastoma patients.Twenty-two patients enrolled in phase I, 47 in phase II. Twelve phase I patients treated at the maximum tolerated dosage were included in the phase II cohort for analysis. The maximum tolerated dosage was 15 mg temsirolimus weekly with erlotinib 150 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were rash and mucositis. Among 42 evaluable glioblastoma patients, 12 (29) achieved stable disease, but there were no responses, and PFS6 was 13. Among 16 anaplastic glioma patients, 1 (6) achieved complete response, 1 (6) partial response, and 2 (12.5) stable disease, with PFS6 of 8. Tumor levels of both drugs were low, and posttreatment tissue in 3 patients showed no reduction in the mTOR target phosphorylated (phospho-)S6(S235/236) but possible compensatory increase in phospho-Akt(S473). Presence of EGFR variant III, phospho-EGFR, and EGFR amplification did not correlate with survival, but patients with elevated phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase or reduced phosphatase and tensin homolog protein expression had decreased progression-free survival at 4 months.Because of increased toxicity, the maximum tolerated dosage of temsirolimus in combination with erlotinib proved lower than expected.

5712,Cooperative inhibitory effect of ZD1839 (Iressa) in combination with 17-AAG on glioma cell growth,"One of the characteristics of all tumors, including brain tumors, is perturbed signal transduction resulting from inherited and/or acquired defects in the genes encoding proteins that stimulate cell proliferation and promote survival   . Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and the group most poorly controlled with current treatments   . High-grade gliomas present a major therapeutic challenge because these aggressive lesions are typically refractory to surgery, radiotherapy, and conventional chemotherapy  . Although new treatment paradigms have had significant impacts on the outcome of many other cancer types, the duration of survival associated with malignant gliomas has not changed in decades    .","ZD1839 (""Iressa"") is an orally active, selective epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We evaluated the antitumor activity of ZD1839 in combination with HSP90 antagonist, 17-AAG in malignant human glioma cell lines. ZD1839 independently produced a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation in glioma cells grown in culture with time- and dose-dependent accumulation of cells in G, phase of the cell cycle on flow cytometric analysis, although the concentrations required for optimal efficacy were at or above the limits of clinically achievable levels. Because the heat shock protein (HSP) is involved in the conformational maturation of a number of signaling proteins critical to the proliferation of malignant glioma cells, we hypothesized that the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG would potentiate ZD1839-mediated glioma cytotoxicity by decreasing the activation status of EGF receptor, as well as downregulating the levels of other relevant signaling effectors. We, therefore, examined the effects of ZD1839 and 17-AAG, alone and in combination, on signal transduction and apoptosis in a series of malignant glioma cell lines. Simultaneous exposure to these inhibitors significantly induced cell death and quantitative analysis revealed that interaction between ZD1839 and 17-AAG-induced cytotoxicity was synergistic, leading to a pronounced increase in active caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. No significant growth inhibition or caspase activation was seen in control cells. The enhanced cytotoxicity of this combination was associated with diminished Akt activation and a significant downregulation of EGFR receptor, Raf-1 and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). Cells exposed to 17-AAG and ZD1839 displayed a significant reduction in cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as CDK4 and CDK6. Taken together, these findings suggest that ZD1839, an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, plays a critical role in regulating the apoptotic response to 17-AAG and that multi-site targeting of growth signaling and cell survival pathways could provide a potent strategy to treat patients with malignant gliomas.

Specifically, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma are only 6.9 and 14.6 months, respectively, despite maximum safe resection and temozolomide chemoradiation  . Following recurrence, salvage therapies have historically achieved 6month PFS rates less than 10% and median survivals of 4 to 6 months    ."," Increased mitogenic signaling and angiogenesis, frequently facilitated by somatic activation of EGF receptor (EGFR; ErbB1) and/or loss of PTEN, and VEGF overexpression, respectively, drive malignant glioma growth. We hypothesized that patients with recurrent glioblastoma would exhibit differential antitumor benefit based on tumor PTEN/EGFRvIII status when treated with the antiangiogenic agent pazopanib and the ErbB inhibitor lapatinib.Experimental Design A phase II study evaluated the antitumor activity of pazopanib 400 mg/d plus lapatinib 1,000 mg/d in patients with grade 4 malignant glioma and known PTEN/EGFRvIII status not receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (EIAC). The phase II study used a two-stage Green-Dahlberg design for futility. An independent, parallel phase I component determined the maximum-tolerated regimen (MTR) of pazopanib and lapatinib in patients with grade 3/4 glioma receiving EIACs. The six-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates in phase II (n = 41) were 0% and 15% in the PTEN/EGFRvIII-positive and PTEN/EGFRvIII-negative cohorts, respectively, leading to early termination. Two patients (5%) had a partial response and 14 patients (34%) had stable disease lasting 8 or more weeks. In phase I (n = 34), the MTR was not reached. On the basis of pharmacokinetic and safety review, a regimen of pazopanib 600 mg plus lapatinib 1,000 mg, each twice daily, was considered safe. Concomitant EIACs reduced exposure to pazopanib and lapatinib. The antitumor activity of this combination at the phase II dose tested was limited.

5775,RTK inhibition looking for the right pathways toward a miracle,"The overall goal of the study is to uncover mechanism(s) of bevacizumab-induced resistance in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  . Levels of VEGF and MET expression in GBM mouse models and patient specimens from pre-and post-bevacizumab therapy were measured; VEGF expression inversely correlated with tumor invasion and MET phosphorylation as if VEGF acts as a negative switch of MET-induced invasive tumor growth. Studies of cross-talk between VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and MET as well as their physical interaction showed that VEGF directly and negatively regulates GBM tumor cell invasion through a MET/VEGFR2 complex (Figure 1) . VEGF knockout mouse astrocytes induce orthotopically nonangiogenic but highly invasive GBM. To prove that VEGF ablation induces invasive tumor growth through METdependent mesenchymal transition that can be further blocked by MET inhibition, MET knockout with shRNA in VEGF knockout mouse models was performed and showed that MET knockdown inhibits tumor invasion and promotes survival of VEGF-deficient tumors. To demonstrate that a similar mesenchymal transition occurs in patient GBM cases resistant to bevacizumab, the authors examined the degree of MET phosphorylation and mesenchymal markers in GBM tumor specimens from pre-and post-bevacizumab patients and found elevated MET activation and mesenchymal transition in post-bevacizumab treatment patient tumor specimens.","Evaluation of Lu KV, Chang JP, Parachoniak CA et at VEGF inhibits tumor cell invasion and mesenchymal transition through a MET/VEGFR2 complex. Cancer Cell 22(1), 21-35 (2012). In glioblastoma, a well-characterized angiogenic target is VEGF. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF and was developed to inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Based on promising results from clinical trials that bevacizumab can prolong progression-free survival in recurrent glioblastoma patients, the US FDA granted this drug accelerated approval for the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma; however, there has been no evidence that the overall median survival of patients is prolonged. More recently, Phase II clinical trials tested bevacizumab in combination with traditional radiation and/or temozolamide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients and again showed prolonged progression-free survival in these patients, but overall survival was not significantly changed. More importantly, there was evidence that tumors resistant to or recurring after bevacizumab treatment often showed a more aggressive phenotype. Due to the lack of effective post-bevacizumab therapies, it has been suggested that treatment with bevacizumab not be used until patients have developed late-stage recurrent tumors. Under these circumstances, there is a timely need to uncover the mechanisms of resistance to bevacizumab. In this article, Lu et al. reported a novel mechanism whereby VEGF negatively regulates tumor cell invasion by blocking MET phosphorylation in the MET/VEGFR2 complex. They showed that inhibiting the VEGF pathway results in MET activation in VEGF-knockout mouse models and in patients after bevacuzimub treatment, and that MET knockdown blocked the invasiveness of VEGF knockout tumors, suggesting that blocking the MET pathway can prevent post-bevacizumab treatment tumor recurrence, providing a strong rationale for using a combination of MET and VEGF receptor inhibitors to treat glioblastoma patients.",https//www.futuremedicine.com/doi/pdfplus/10.2217/fon.12.130
5784,Evaluation of the Safety and Benefit of Phase I Oncology Trials for Patients With Primary CNS Tumors,"The primary objectives of phase I oncology trials are to determine the safety, toxicity, maximumtolerated dose (MTD), preliminary efficacy, and recommended dose of novel agents for phase II and III studies.  In the era of targeted therapies, phase I trials are increasingly enriched for patients with predictive biomarkers to obtain an efficacy signal to make go or no-go decisions in drug development.  To maximize patient safety and minimize the chance of nonreproducible results, phase I studies use strict eligibility criteria that have historically excluded patients with primary CNS tumors such as glioblastoma.   The reasons given to exclude such patients include poor prognosis, excessive toxicities, neurologic complications, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with antiepileptics, and limited efficacy as a result of poor penetration across the blood-brain barrier.   A recent analysis of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (NCI-CTEP) phase I clinical trial database of more than 000 patients with solid tumors enrolled between 000 and 00 found only eight patients who had primary or metastatic CNS tumors (Ͻ 0.%).

5800,Autophagic and Apoptotic Pathways as Targets for Chemotherapy in Glioblastoma,"Brain tumors are a group of highly aggressive and lethal neoplastic diseases  . In recent years they reached an approximate incidence of 6-7 cases per 100,000 persons-year  . Gliomas are the main neoplastic diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS), accounting for approximately 50% of all brain neoplasms  . Gliomas are derived from glial cells, and the World Health Organization classifies them in several subtypes according to their histological characteristics. Oligodendrogliomas are derived from oligodendrocytes; oligoastrocytomas have a mixed origin, from astrocytomas and oligodendrocytomas; and astrocytomas are derived from astrocytes, being the most frequently observed gliomas. In turn, astrocytomas can be classified according to their degree of malignancy and the severity of their clinical signs into four grades  . Grade I astrocytomas exhibit the least malignancy; they are characterized by a low invasiveness, which facilitates their complete surgical removal. Grade II astrocytomas are characterized by a slow progression; however, their surgical cure is hindered by a more extensive infiltration. Grade III astrocytomas show a more rapid progression; they are highly infiltrative and histologically exhibit a marked proliferative activity. Finally, grade IV astrocytomas, commonly called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are characterized by poorly differentiated neoplastic astrocytes with cellular polymorphism, nuclear atypia, high mitotic activity, necrosis, vascular proliferation, and thrombosis  . These tumors exhibit a great local invasiveness, involving preferential anatomic pathways through the brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space, perivascular space, and white matter tracts; this suggests a variable permissiveness of stroma to the tumorigenic process. This glial tumor infiltration at 1-2 cm from the original tumor mass prevents a total tumor resection after surgery and results in a high rate of tumor recurrence  . Gliomas remain refractory to surgical treatment, radiotherapy, systemic or local chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Epidemiological studies have reported that patient survival is approximately 12-15 months after diagnosis, despite the treatment  . The resistance of GBM to a range of therapies is mainly due to a highly mutated genome, which also leads to significant tumor heterogeneity. This involves the overactivation of the RAS/RAF, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, by activating tyrosine kinase receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGR), and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), which have been found upregulated in GBM    . These signaling pathways are known to regulate cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion, as well as apoptosis and autophagy ( Figure 1) ; thus, a dysregulation of these signaling pathways favors tumor formation, progression, aggressiveness, and resistance to various therapies   . One of the major contributors to the observed resistance of GBM to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the dysregulation of death cell pathways such as autophagy and apoptosis  , leading to an overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), B cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL), and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1)) and cell survival proteins (RAS, PI3K, ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), AKT, mTOR, and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α)), as well as decreased levels of several pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bad, Bok, NOXA, and apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1))  . There is some evidence that an inhibition of the autophagic process improves the efficacy of irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents, increasing the cytotoxicity of some treatments   . On the other hand, an increase in autophagy has been linked to a higher therapeutic efficacy in several treatments based on apoptosis induction    .","Glioblastoma multiforme is the most malignant and aggressive type of brain tumor, with a mean life expectancy of less than 15 months. This is due in part to the high resistance to apoptosis and moderate resistant to autophagic cell death in glioblastoma cells, and to the poor therapeutic response to conventional therapies. Autophagic cell death represents an alternative mechanism to overcome the resistance of glioblastoma to pro-apoptosis-related therapies. Nevertheless, apoptosis induction plays a major conceptual role in several experimental studies to develop novel therapies against brain tumors. In this review, we outline the different components of the apoptotic and autophagic pathways and explore the mechanisms of resistance to these cell death pathways in glioblastoma cells. Finally, we discuss drugs with clinical and preclinical use that interfere with the mechanisms of survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and cell death of malignant cells, favoring the induction of apoptosis and autophagy, or the inhibition of the latter leading to cell death, as well as their therapeutic potential in glioma, and examine new perspectives in this promising research field.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/ijms/ijms-19-03773/article_deploy/ijms-19-03773-v2.pdf

This phase I clinical trial was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of COL-3 in adults with recurrent high-grade glioma, to describe the effects of enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs (EIADs) on its pharmacokinetics, and to obtain preliminary evidence of activity. Adults with recurrent high-grade glioma were stratified by EIAD use. COL-3 was given orally daily without interruption until disease progression or treatment-related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Three patients in each EIAD group were evaluated at each dose level beginning with 25 mg/m(2)/day and escalated by 25 mg/m(2)/day. Toxicity, response, and pharmacokinetics were assessed. Thirty-three patients were evaluated. The MTD was 75 mg/m(2)/day in the -EIAD patients while one was not determined in +EIAD patients. The common toxicities observed were anemia, ataxia, diarrhea, hypokalemia, CNS hemorrhage, and myalgia. One partial response was observed. -EIAD patients tended to have a higher steady-state trough concentration that was apparent only at the 100 mg/m(2)/day dose level (P = 0.01). This study suggests that (a) EIAD use does affect the pharmacokinetics of COL-3 at higher doses; and (b) there was not enough suggestion of single-agent activity to warrant further study in recurrent high-grade gliomas.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-011-0602-9.pdf
5882,Cell Surface Notch Ligand DLL3 is a Therapeutic Target in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase-mutant Glioma,"Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and IDH2 genes identify a subtype of glioma with distinct biological, clinical, and radiographic features      . These gliomas develop through early mutation of IDH  , which results in accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (7) and a genome-wide DNA hypermethylation phenotype  , followed by acquisition of one of two sets of cooccurring genetic alterations TP53 and ATRX mutations, or 1p/ 19q codeletion and mutations in TERT, CIC, and FUBP1     . More recent studies have identified a small subset of more aggressive IDH-mutant gliomas associated with lower global DNA methylation  and homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion  , and alterations that are frequently acquired at recurrence, including temozolomide-induced hypermutation phenotype  , Myc pathway alterations  , and driver oncogenes and tumor suppressors    ."," Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant glioma is a distinct glioma molecular subtype for which no effectivemolecularly directed therapy exists. Low-grade gliomas, which are 80%-90% IDH-mutant, have high RNA levels of the cell surface Notch ligandDLL3. We sought to determineDLL3 expression by IHC in glioma molecular subtypes and the potential efficacy of an anti-DLL3 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), in IDH-mutant glioma.Experimental Design We evaluated DLL3 expression by RNA using TCGA data and by IHC in a discovery set of 63 gliomas and 20 nontumor brain tissues and a validation set of 62 known IDH wild-type and mutant gliomas using a monoclonal anti-DLL3 antibody. Genotype was determined using a DNA methylation array classifier or by sequencing. The effect of Rova-T on patient-derived endogenous IDH-mutant glioma tumorspheres was determined by cell viability assay. Compared to IDH wild-type glioblastoma, IDH-mutant gliomas have significantly higher DLL3 RNA (P < 1 x 10(-15)) and protein by IHC (P = 0.0014 and P < 4.3 x 10(-6) in the discovery and validation set, respectively). DLL3 immunostaining was intense and homogeneous in IDH-mutant gliomas, retained in all recurrent tumors, and detected in only 1 of 20 nontumor brains. Patient-derived IDH-mutant glioma tumorspheres overexpressed DLL3 and were potently sensitive to Rova-T in an antigen-dependent manner. DLL3 is selectively and homogeneously expressed in IDH-mutant gliomas and can be targeted with Rova-T in patient-derived IDH-mutant glioma tumorspheres.

5928,beta 1 Integrin Targeting Potentiates Antiangiogenic Therapy and Inhibits the Growth of Bevacizumab-Resistant Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults, with a median survival close to 1 year (1). To date, only 3 drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for glioblastoma treatment, including, most recently, bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech) in 2009  . Despite improvements in clinical metrics with bevacizumab including cognitive benefits and reduction of steroid use (3), 40% of treated patients developed acquired resistance in phase II trials  . Thus, as has been the case with other cancers treated with antiangiogenic therapy, the promise of antiangiogenesis in glioblastoma remains unfulfilled in part due to acquired resistance.","Antiangiogenic therapies like bevacizumab offer promise for cancer treatment, but acquired resistance, which often includes an aggressive mesenchymal phenotype, can limit the use of these agents. Upregulation of beta 1 integrin (ITGB1) occurs in some bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas (BRG) whereby, mediating tumor-microenvironment interactions, we hypothesized that it may mediate a mesenchymal-type resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. Immunostaining analyses of beta 1 integrin and its downstream effector kinase FAK revealed upregulation in 75% and 86% of BRGs, respectively, compared with pretreatment paired specimens. Furthermore, flow cytometry revealed eight-fold more beta 1 integrin in primary BRG cells compared with cells from bevacizumab-naive glioblastomas (BNG). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of cells engineered to express a beta 1-GFP fusion protein indicated that the mobile beta 1 integrin fraction was doubled, and half-life of beta 1 integrin turnover in focal adhesions was reduced markedly in BRG cells compared with bevacizumab-responsive glioblastoma multiforme cells. Hypoxia, which was increased with acquisition of bevacizumab resistance, was associated with increased beta 1 integrin expression in cultured BNG cells. BRGs displayed an aggressive mesenchymal-like phenotype in vitro. We found that growth of BRG xenograft tumors was attenuated by the beta 1 antibody, OS2966, allowing a 20-fold dose reduction of bevacizumab per cycle in this model. Intracranial delivery of OS2966 through osmotic pumps over 28 days increased tumor cell apoptosis, decreased tumor cell invasiveness, and blunted the mesenchymal morphology of tumor cells. We concluded that beta 1 integrin upregulation in BRGs likely reflects an onset of hypoxia caused by antiangiogenic therapy, and that beta 1 inhibition is well tolerated in vivo as a tractable strategy to disrupt resistance to this therapy.

Ziel von Immuntherapien bei Gliomen ist somit einerseits die Stärkung von gegen den Tumor gerichteten Immunantworten, andererseits die Hemmung der Immunevasion. » Hirntumoren können nebenwirkungsarm immuntherapeutisch behandelt werden Auch wenn es bis heute keine zugelassene Immuntherapie für Gliome gibt, zeigen Studien, dass Hirntumoren ohne schwerwiegende Nebenwirkungen immuntherapeutisch behandelt werden können. Dies hat zur präklinischen Entwicklung neuer immunologischer Therapieansätze geführt, die spezifisch an die Herausforderungen von Hirntumoren angepasst sind und aktuell im Rahmen klinischer Studien untersucht werden.

Immunotherapeutic approaches for treatment of malignant gliomas aim at inducing effective anti-tumor immune responses while counteracting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Despite extensive preclinical and clinical research during the last decades, there are currently no approved immunotherapeutic drugs for primary brain tumors; however, neuro-oncoimmunology is currently experiencing major interest due to new diagnostic and targeted therapy options as well as due to promising results in systemic tumors.This article provides an overview of current concepts for glioma immunotherapy and summarizes the results of available clinical trials.While first clinical experiences with the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors for gliomas did not raise any safety concerns, the efficacy of immune checkpoint monotherapy for malignant gliomas appears to be limited in an unselected patient population. Clinical results on combination treatment, such as T cell-based therapy approaches with antigen-specific vaccinations are pending. This involves mostly peptide vaccines that are directed against tumor antigens in order to generate an effective and at the same time specific anti-tumor immune response. In addition to vaccines against individually variable antigens, recurrent neoepitopes are particularly suitable as a target of vaccination, such as a splice variant of the epidermal growth factor (EGFRvIII) occurring in glioblastomas and a point mutation occurring in diffuse gliomas in the gene of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1R132H).",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00761-017-0258-y.pdf
5976,Antitumor activity of rapamycin in a phase I trial for patients with recurrent PTEN-Deficient glioblastoma,"There is much discussion in the cancer drug development community about how to incorporate molecular tools into early-stage clinical trials to assess target modulation, measure anti-tumor activity, and enrich the clinical trial population for patients who are more likely to benefit. Small, molecularly focused clinical studies offer the promise of the early definition of optimal biologic dose and patient population."," There is much discussion in the cancer drug development community about how to incorporate molecular tools into early-stage clinical trials to assess target modulation, measure anti-tumor activity, and enrich the clinical trial population for patients who are more likely to benefit. Small, molecularly focused clinical studies offer the promise of the early definition of optimal biologic dose and patient population.s and Findings Based on preclinical evidence that phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on Chromosome 10 (PTEN) loss sensitizes tumors to the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR), we conducted a proof-of-concept Phase I neoadjuvant trial of rapamycin in patients with recurrent glioblastoma, whose tumors lacked expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN. We aimed to assess the safety profile of daily rapamycin in patients with glioma, define the dose of rapamycin required for mTOR inhibition in tumor tissue, and evaluate the antiproliferative activity of rapamycin in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma. Although intratumoral rapamycin concentrations that were sufficient to inhibit mTOR in vitro were achieved in all patients, the magnitude of mTOR inhibition in tumor cells ( measured by reduced ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation) varied substantially. Tumor cell proliferation ( measured by Ki-67 staining) was dramatically reduced in seven of 14 patients after 1 wk of rapamycin treatment and was associated with the magnitude of mTOR inhibition (p=0.0047, Fisher exact test) but not the intratumoral rapamycin concentration. Tumor cells harvested from the Ki-67 nonresponders retained sensitivity to rapamycin ex vivo, indicating that clinical resistance to biochemical mTOR inhibition was not cell-intrinsic. Rapamycin treatment led to Akt activation in seven patients, presumably due to loss of negative feedback, and this activation was associated with shorter time-to-progression during post-surgical maintenance rapamycin therapy (p < 0.05, Logrank test). Rapamycin has anticancer activity in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma and warrants further clinical study alone or in combination with PI3K pathway inhibitors. The short-term treatment endpoints used in this neoadjuvant trial design identified the importance of monitoring target inhibition and negative feedback to guide future clinical development.",https//storage.googleapis.com/plos-corpus-prod/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050008/1/pmed.0050008.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=wombat-sa%40plos-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20210302%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20210302T014747Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=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
6022,Advances in radiotherapy and comprehensive treatment of high-grade glioma immunotherapy and tumor-treating fields,"Glioma is the most common primary intracranial malignant tumor and accounts for 30% of all central nervous system tumors   . The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors places gliomas into grades I-IV, with grades I and II indicating low-grade gliomas and grades III and IV, high-grade gliomas (HGGs)  . The incidence of HGGs is approximately 5 per 100,000 person-years. Researches have shown that gliomas are more common in adults and the elderly than in children; they also occur more often in men than in women     . HGGs are characterized by the ""three high and one low"" principle high incidence rate, high recurrence rate, high mortality, and low cure rate.","High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the most common primary malignant brain tumors. They have a high degree of malignancy and show invasive growth. The personal treatment plan for HGG is based on the patient's age, performance status, and degree of tumor invasion. The basic treatment plan for HGG involves tumor resection, radiotherapy (RT) with concomitant temozolomide (TMZ), and adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy. The basic radiation technology includes conventional RT, three-dimensional conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT, and stereotactic RT. As our understanding of tumor pathogenesis has deepened, so-called comprehensive treatment schemes have attracted attention. These combine RT with chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or tumor-treating fields. These emerging treatments are expected to improve the prospects of patients with HGG.

6048,Correlation of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant use with outcome of patients with glioblastoma,"treatment, and protocol specific variables were obtained from all patients. Baseline seizure history information was available only in the subgroup of patients treated at the Mayo Clinic."," Clinical trials involving patients with glioblastoma (GBM) distinguish cohorts who are treated with enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (EIAC). Such anticonvulsants induce hepatic P450 microsomal enzymes, which accelerate the metabolism of certain chemotherapy and molecular targeted agents. However, the resultant effect of such induction on patient outcome has received limited study.s We performed a correlative analysis of baseline EIAC use with outcome, using a cross-sectional database of 620 patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated prospectively on North Central Cancer Treatment Group trials. At registration, 72% were receiving treatment with EIAC; 2% were receiving non-EIACs, and the 26% were not receiving anticonvulsants (26%). Surprisingly, in the multivariable Cox model, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) showed a positive correlation with EIAC use (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75, p = 0.0028 and HR = 0.80, p = 0.022), even after adjustment for the known prognostic factors of age, performance status, extent of resection, steroid use, and baseline neurocognitive function. Specifically, the median OS was longer in EIAC compared with non-EIAC patients (12.3 vs 10.7 months, p = 0.0002). Similarly, PFS was longer in EIAC patients (5.6 vs 4.8 months, p = 0.003). No differences in median OS or PFS were observed when comparing patients with or without a history of seizures at baseline. Paradoxically, enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant (EIAC) use correlated with superior outcome of patients with glioblastoma. These results suggest that in comparative clinical trials testing agents metabolized by P450 microsomal enzymes, treatment arms may need stratification for the proportion of patients receiving EIAC.

Despite standard first-line treatment, almost all tumors recur. Salvage therapeutic options are limited and overall prognosis is poor   . In search of better therapeutic strategies, researchers have sought to better understand the pathophysiology underlying the development of GBM. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a government-funded initiative to catalog and ascertain genomic alterations in cancer pathogenesis, used GBM as its first study disease. It has since identified three core pathways that lead to the development of GBM (i) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/ phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), (ii) p53, and (iii) retinoblastoma (Rb) pathways   (Fig. 1) ."," of ReviewTargeted therapies are part of biomarker-driven strategies that exploit actionable molecular targets and have gained traction following survival benefits demonstrated in various systemic malignancies. In glioblastoma, where therapeutic options remain scarce and prognosis poor, targeted therapies offer an attractive treatment alternative and are actively examined in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the targeted therapies, including traditional small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies as well as immunotherapeutic approaches that are examined in clinical trials, and discuss the challenges of using them for the treatment of glioblastoma.Recent FindingsDespite initial speculations, phase II/III trials of targeted therapies in adult patients with glioblastoma have largely failed. Recent trials have focused on improving patient stratification, drug-tissue penetration, and target and compensatory pathway inhibition to optimize treatment response. In contrast to traditional small molecule and monoclonal antibody therapies, cancer immunotherapy may target specific molecular or immune checkpoint target(s) to trigger immune responses against glioblastoma. Early phase clinical trials of immunotherapy have shown encouraging results, and larger randomized trials are ongoing.SummaryTargeted therapies are being actively studied in clinical trials.

6098,Blood-brain barrier disruption with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors a review and perspectives,"drugs.  Intraarterial chemotherapy injection consists of locoregional delivery of the drug via the cerebral arteries; a systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that this invasive approach is not superior to intravenous chemotherapy in terms of efficacy and OS.  Osmotic disruption of the BBB is performed using hypertonic agents, such as mannitol, injected into a cerebral artery. Although it can increase delivery of drugs into the brain compared to systemic injection alone, the delivery is largely reversed within 10 minutes and not targeted to the tumor, and this technique may induce seizures and increase intracranial pressure. Moreover, osmotic disruption of the BBB in association with carboplatin was inactive in pediatric highgrade and brainstem gliomas. 0 The functional activity of the BBB can also be targeted by inhibition of the drug efflux transporter system. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein with cyclosporin A was evaluated in patients with DIPG in association with etoposide, vincristine, and radiation therapy, but the regimen proved excessively toxic.  Convection-enhanced delivery has been largely studied during the last decades, including in patients with DIPG. The first clinical data are encouraging, but volumes of delivery with this invasive technique are still limited.  BBB disruption (BBBD) using low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPU) in animals has recently emerged as a promising technique.  This technique has been widely assessed in preclinical studies and was first translated to clinical trials in 2014.  Encouraging results have since been observed in adult patients treated for recurrent glioblastoma.   In this review, the characteristics of the BBB in the most common pediatric brain tumors are reviewed. Then, we focus on ultrasound (US)-induced opening of the BBB to review the principles, mechanisms, and histological and biological effects of BBBD with US; we summarize preclinical studies that have used US-induced BBB opening on tumor models; and we report recent clinical trials that have been initiated.","Pediatric brain tumors are the most common solid tumor and the first cause of cancer death in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Current treatments are far from optimal in most of these tumors and the prognosis remains dismal for many of them. One of the main causes of the failure of current medical treatments is in part due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits drug delivery to tumors. Opening of the BBB with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPU) has emerged during the last 2 decades as a promising technique for enhancing drug delivery to the brain. In preclinical models, enhanced delivery of a wide range of therapeutic agents, from low-molecular-weight drugs, to antibodies and immune cells, has been observed as well as tumor control and increased survival. This technique has recently entered clinical trials with extracranial and intracranial devices. The safety and feasibility of this technique has furthermore been shown in patients treated monthly for recurrent glioblastoma receiving carboplatin chemotherapy. In this review, the characteristics of the BBB in the most common pediatric brain tumors are reviewed. Then, principles and mechanisms of BBB disruption with ultrasound (US) are summarized and described at the histological and biological levels. Lastly, preclinical studies that have used US-induced BBB opening in tumor models, recent clinical trials, and the potential use of this technology in pediatrics are provided.",https//thejns.org/downloadpdf/journals/neurosurg-focus/48/1/article-pE10.pdf
6116,Phase 0 and window of opportunity clinical trial design in neuro-oncology a RANO review,"Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain neoplasm.  The median survival after initial diagnosis is less than one year without treatment.  Surgical resection alone is insufficient to control tumor progression given that glioblastoma is an infiltrative disease. The addition of radiation and chemotherapy significantly improves median patient survival to -6 months in clinical trial populations,  and this may be further extended by use of tumor-treating fields.  Despite intensive research and numerous clinical trials, no chemotherapeutic drug except temozolomide has been proven effective at unequivocally slowing the relentless growth of this devastating neoplasm in a randomized clinical trial. Facilitating early clinical testing of promising targets can have a meaningful impact on improving our ability to conduct trials on agents that hold real promise for survival benefit.","Glioblastoma is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. Few effective chemotherapeutics are currently available, and much effort has been expended to identify new drugs capable of slowing tumor progression. The phase 0 trial design was developed to facilitate early identification of promising agents for cancer that should undergo accelerated approval. This design features an early in-human study that enrolls a small number of patients who receive subtherapeutic doses of medication with the goals of describing pharmacokinetics through drug blood level measurements and determining intratumoral concentrations of the investigational compound as well as pharmacodynamics by studying the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs. In neuro-oncology, however, the presence of the blood-brain barrier and difficulty in obtaining brain tumor tissue warrant a separate set of considerations. In this paper, we critically reviewed the protocols used in all brain tumor related in-human phase 0 and phase 0-like (""window of opportunity"") studies between 1993 and 2018, as well as ongoing clinical trials, and identified major challenges in trial design as applied to central nervous system tumors that include surgical specimen collection and storage, brain tumor drug level analysis, and confirmation of drug action. We therefore propose that phase 0 trials in neuro-oncology should include (i) only patients in whom a resection of the tumor is planned, (ii) use of clinical doses of an investigational agent, (iii) tissue sampling from enhancing and non-enhancing portions of the tumor, and (iv) assessment of drug-specific target effects. Standardization of clinical protocols for phase 0/ window of opportunity studies can help accelerate the development of effective treatments for glioblastoma.Importance of the StudyFew effective chemotherapeutics are currently available for treating glioblastoma despite extensive clinical investigation of a multitude of compounds. The presence of a blood-brain barrier makes it challenging to rely on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that are generated from investigations in systemic cancers. Phase 0/window of opportunity clinical trial designs can be used to determine the intratumoral concentrations of the investigational compound as well as pharmacodynamics by studying the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs in tumor tissue. This report provides specific consensus guidance regarding the use of Phase 0-like/window of opportunity clinical trial designs in NeuroOncology with the goal of evaluating drug-treated brain tumor tissue to help guide therapeutic development and minimize the risk of undertaking futile efficacyoriented clinical trials.",https//watermark.silverchair.com/noaa149.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAtAwggLMBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggK9MIICuQIBADCCArIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMaluQxvJwJw6Mg0UAAgEQgIICg62ytodc6e9ii1FKPO5G4xgYFfsOdoP9DrISE6LnDFkGgcl4Xaw413AiulVqWDM5nRsftxgJhZxpt--6yEReZp1Wscxxm6rhh_LT1oYk0FCxQBBxECnwdK94CIPEU_rOHcnoMsXBi3jwW-J0vFMS-77hqkbUEmw_81W-2pB4Z892GNm4rULM9QpwNwM1-pvfqjAvUT1z6o5YMIEZ5bPjVkzNdBl5nHdgAgttcuJQvzmCq-3GhBn1vIGpmUles7eLcOWgr1oxj2fv3ca_0GxcNJ3jqWDmCKa9E7_A-8U3xbkO1ai2gmri0FEu0Annzgh3ZpOSEB-4kxAmJGlRx8CqaqjblEz-9YnCaEkphqCZEUV6_tFdPl04YYqAwyDkMxZPC5itEJ7ohRmOuSEZeuyqWPDO1oQ-Bo5iLM-X2mgRKaQBDy2HR_nBQ3BiQC8Gy0lRWtZ2M3Zc2DWEP1673uj4cjkNcBciJMyPAyrmE6bio8W6N0UrxHDybEzJ1-ESuo09BhkcXu2Gi4nnM0q77LFTcolWVI7Bnc7s18yz_QmYihF9zMe-ZWPEGSOsqAqs8AYPjsgHgzKMWxouTlGk5H93WZNeRCy3W2eKOyeQKJdHnDANhgVascwYBbUoX196ZwVoNHpuACw8Rcy8yfBHLmeX5hrEoAalA5ExG4F424hwk-FCDuyKT4Ota1ZYpggtE2xgOtgqKu9nGAem7NB2LFTb9jFebeaoORALPmI_jw4tA6jxRkBolrSQ18KGpL_xE3IuTWFgWadHxNKAugi5NnQ9HDe9dMx4znH3u91N1VMkyAZIEGZFu34ycUrNYjRqgBUmYvz9hyUf6e30LqDsCaMN6UhefqI
6145,"Integration of genomics, high throughput drug screening, and personalized xenograft models as a novel precision medicine paradigm for high risk pediatric cancer","Improvements in outcomes for childhood cancer mean that the majority of children with cancer are now cured with standard cytotoxic therapies alone. However there are specific tumor types that still portend dismal prognoses and most children with relapsed disease have poor outcomes. Brain tumors in children now account for the single disease entity responsible for the most deaths in childhood. To improve outcomes for these children, many groups are focusing on the development of personalized medicine platforms that seek to integrate genomic testing into decision making practices in order to identify novel, individualized, and effective targeted therapies for each child. ,  This strategy has, thus far, had limited success in many adult cancers, and significant challenges remain in pediatric cancer.   A particularly concern is the lower mutational burden of childhood cancers, thus increasing the difficulty in finding effective drug targets.  Moreover, the discovery of a targetable mutation does not always equate to drug response. This is especially true for central nervous system (CNS) tumors, where penetration of the blood brain barrier (BBB) is an added impediment to treatment efficacy.   Gliomas are primary brain malignancies which account for the majority of pediatric tumors involving the CNS.  While in children most are low grade, high grade tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM), remain a formidable challenge. The current standard management is maximal surgical resection followed by irradiation. Temozolomide is often used as an adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment, although its efficacy in the pediatric population has not clearly been established.  Recent advances in genomic analysis have identified 6 distinct molecular subgroups of GBM, and mutually exclusive patterns of mutations in the p Rb and PI3K pathways.  This emphasizes the molecular heterogeneity of GBM, and highlights the potential to identify targetable genetic alterations that may lead to a more directed therapy in pediatric patients. Patients with high-grade gliomas with activating BRAF mutations, for example, have been shown to have profound responses to BRAF inhibitors.  1 While these tumors make up a very small subgroup of patients, they highlight the potential utility of more extensive tumor profiling, including genomic and drug response assays. We hypothesized that a comprehensive precision medicine approach including molecular, in vitro and in vivo tumor profiling platform would highlight additional therapeutic options. Here we present a pediatric case of a high grade malignant brain tumor, that most closely resembled a GBM, and highlight the utility of combining molecular profiling, high throughput drug screening and in vivo drug efficacy testing to identify potential personalized therapies for high grade glioma (HGG) and potentially other aggressive childhood cancers in a clinically meaningful timeframe.","Pediatric high grade gliomas (HGG) are primary brain malignancies that result in significant morbidity and mortality. One of the challenges in their treatment is inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Precision medicine approaches have the potential to enhance diagnostic, prognostic and/or therapeutic information. In this case study we describe the molecular characterization of a pediatric HGG and the use of an integrated approach based on genomic, in vitro and in vivo testing to identify actionable targets and treatment options. Molecular analysis based on WGS performed on initial and recurrent tumor biopsies revealed mutations in TP53, TSC1 and CIC genes, focal amplification of MYCN, and copy number gains in SMO and c-MET. Transcriptomic analysis identified increased expression of MYCN, and genes involved in sonic hedgehog signaling proteins (SHH, SMO, GLI1, GLI2) and receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (PLK, AURKA, c-MET). HTS revealed no cytotoxic efficacy of SHH pathway inhibitors while sensitivity was observed to the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, the ALK inhibitor ceritinib, and the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536. Based on the integrated approach, temsirolimus, ceritinib, BI2536 and standard therapy temozolomide were selected for further in vivo evaluation. Using the PDX animal model (median survival 28 days) we showed significant in vivo activity for mTOR inhibition by temsirolimus and BI2536 (median survival 109 and 115.5 days respectively) while ceritinib and temozolomide had only a moderate effect (43 and 75.5 days median survival respectively). This case study demonstrates that an integrated approach based on genomic, in vitro and in vivo drug efficacy testing in a PDX model may be useful to guide the management of high risk pediatric brain tumor in a clinically meaningful timeframe.",https//www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15384047.2018.1491498?needAccess=true
6169,CPEB1 modulates differentiation of glioma stem cells via downregulation of HES1 and SIRT1 expression,"The degree of glioma malignancy is graded using a World Health Organization (WHO) consensus-derived scale of I to IV, as determined by histological features and genetic alterations  . Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and biologically aggressive form of WHO grade IV gliomas, has increased in incidence and has a very poor prognosis, with an average survival of only 14~16 months despite maximal therapy   . Treatment failure may be due to the inability of currently available therapies to eliminate cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are regarded as responsible for tumor initiation, progression, invasion, recurrence, and drug resistance  . CSCs are a subpopulation of cells in the tumor that have selfrenewal capacity and can give rise to the various cells that comprise these tumors  . Glioma stem cells (GSCs) were the first cancer stem cell isolated from solid tumors  . Whereas one million non-GSCs were needed to generate parental tumors when implanted into immunodeficient mice, as few as 100 GSCs were required  . The existence of GSCs provided a plausible explanation for glioma recurrence following treatment. CD133 + GSCs were found to be more resistant to radiation in vitro than CD133cells because of induction of DNA repair pathways  . In addition, GSCs were found to overexpress ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCTs) such as ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) to export the chemotherapeutic agent extracellularly  .","Glioma stemness has been recognized as the most important reason for glioma relapse and drug resistance. Differentiation of glioma stem cells (GSCs) has been implicated as a novel approach to target recurrent glioma. However, the detailed molecular mechanism involved in the differentiation of GSCs has not yet been elucidated. This study identified CPEB1 as the key modulator that induces the differentiation of GSCs at the post-transcriptional level. Gain and loss of function experiments showed that CPEB1 expression reduced sphere formation ability and the expression of stemness markers such as Nestin and Notch. To elucidate the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the action of CPEB1, we investigated the interacting ribonome of the CPEB1 complex using a Ribonomics approach. CPEB1 specifically suppressed the translation of HES1 and SIRT1 by interacting with a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element. The expression profile of CPEB1 negatively correlated with overall survival in glioma patients. Overexpression of CPEB1 decreased the number of GSCs in an orthotopically implanted glioma animal model. These results suggest that CPEB1-mediated translational control is essential for the differentiation of GSCs and provides novel therapeutic concepts for differentiation therapy.",https//www.oncotarget.com/article/2250/pdf/
6207,Atypical Cell Populations Associated with Acquired Resistance to Cytostatics and Cancer Stem Cell Features The Role of Mitochondria in Nuclear Encapsulation,"Until recently, acquired resistance to cytostatics had mostly been attributed to biochemical mechanisms such as decreased intake and/or increased efflux of therapeutics, enhanced DNA repair, and altered activity or deregulation of target proteins. Although these mechanisms have been widely investigated, little is known about membrane barriers responsible for the chemical imperviousness of cell compartments and cellular segregation in cytostatic-treated tumors. In highly heterogeneous cross-resistant and radiorefractory cell populations selected by exposure to anticancer agents, we found a number of atypical recurrent cell types in  tumor cell cultures of different embryonic origins, (2) mouse xenografts, and 3paraffin sections from patient tumors.

The first type, named spiral cells, is marked by a spiral arrangement of nuclei. The second type, monastery cells, is characterized by prominent walls inside which daughter cells can be seen maturing amid a rich mitochondrial environment.

Although these mechanisms have been widely investigated, little is known about membrane barriers responsible for the chemical imperviousness of cell compartments and cellular segregation in cytostatic-treated tumors. In highly heterogeneous cross-resistant and radiorefractory cell populations selected by exposure to anticancer agents, we found a number of atypical recurrent cell types in (1) tumor cell cultures of different embryonic origins, (2) mouse xenografts, and (3) paraffin sections from patient tumors.

6274,A pilot study I-131-Antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81c6 to deliver a 44-Gy resection cavity boost,"A dults with primary malignant glioma have an unacceptably poor outcome. Although temozolomide plus radiotherapy improves survival of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, most patients develop tumor progression within 1 - years. Outcome following recurrence is poor.  Most tumors recur at or adjacent to the site of origin, indicating that failure to eradicate local tumor growth is a major factor contributing to poor outcome. For this reason, we have focused on augmenting local control to improve overall outcome by administering tumor-associated radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directly into spontaneous tumor cysts, surgically Copyright 00 by the Society for Neuro-Oncology created resection cavities (SCRCs), the intrathecal space, and solid tumors.  Tenascin, an extracellular matrix hexabrachion glycoprotein, is expressed ubiquitously in several cancers, including high-grade gliomas, but not in normal brain.   mAb 1C6, a murine isotype b immunoglobulin G (IgGb) that binds to an alternatively spliced region of tenascin, 9 -1 reacts specifically with tenascin-expressing tumors.  When labeled with 1 I, 1C6 delays tumor growth and prolongs survival in flank and intracranial human xenograft models.   An initial human experience demonstrated the specificity of I-labeled murine 1C6 ( 1 I-1C6) mAb compared to  I-labeled nonspecific IgGb mAb but also revealed limited intratumor penetration following intravenous or intraarterial administration.  Hence, subsequent studies incorporated administration into an SCRC, tumor cyst, or intrathecal space. Prior phase I studies established the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 1 I-1C6 injected into the SCRC of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant brain tumors to be mCi and 0 mCi, respectively.   Phase II studies demonstrated that patients treated with 1 I-1C6 had favorable overall survival compared to established historical controls.   Based on constraints of our U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved phase I and II studies, patients received a ""fixed"" dose of I-1C6 in which the administered level of radioactivity was the same among groups of patients. As a result of this design, 1 I dosages were not adjusted to compensate for patient-specific variables such as SCRC volume and SCRC residence time. Dosimetry of patients treated on these studies revealed a wide range of radiation absorbed doses at the SCRC margin. Moreover, outcome correlated with delivered radiation dose to the SCRC. Specifically, patients who received less than 44 Gy were more likely to develop recurrent tumor, whereas those who received significantly more than 44 Gy were more likely to develop radionecrosis. Therefore, a 44-Gy boost to the SCRC margin was considered optimal.  We now report a pilot study using a novel, patient-specific dosing strategy of 1 I-1C6 designed to achieve a 44-Gy boost to the -cm SCRC margin in adults with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas.","The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and assess the efficacy and toxicity, among newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients, of administering I-131-labeled murine antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 (I-131-81C6) into a surgically created resection cavity (SCRC) to achieve a patient-specific, 44-Gy boost to the 2-cm SCRC margin. A radioactivity dose of I-131-81C6 calculated to achieve a 44-Gy boost to the SCRC was administered, followed by conventional external beam radiotherapy (XRT) and chemotherapy. Twenty-one patients were enrolled in the study 16 with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 5 with anaplastic astrocytoma. Twenty patients received the targeted 44-Gy boost (+/-10%) to the SCRC. Attributable toxicity was mild and limited to reversible grade 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (n = 3; 14%), CNS wound infections (n = 3; 14%), and headache (n = 2; 10%). With a median follow-up of 151 weeks, median overall survival times for all patients and those with GBM are 96.6 and 90.6 weeks, respectively; 87% of GBM patients are alive at 1 year. It is feasible to consistently achieve a 44-Gy boost dose to the SCRC margin with patient-specific dosing of I-131-81C6. Our study regimen (I-131-81C6 + XRT + temozolomide) was well tolerated and had encouraging survival. To determine if selection of good-prognosis patients affects outcome associated with this approach, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a trial randomizing newly diagnosed GBM patients to either our study regimen or standard XRT plus temozolomide.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2613820/pdf/neu10-2-182.pdf
6300,Dissecting and rebuilding the glioblastoma microenvironment with engineered materials,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggres sive primary central nervous system tumour, with a dev astatingly low median patient survival of 15 months  2 (Box 1). Standard treatment consists of surgical resection, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy 3 . However, GBMs exhibit a diffuse invasion pattern, in which tumour cells either migrate individually or collectively infiltrate healthy tissue beyond the tumour margin 4 , making complete surgical resection virtually impossible 5 . Radiotherapy protocols cover a 2 cm margin beyond the visible tumour margin; however, microscopic tumour invasion may spread beyond this distance 6 . Infiltrating tumour cells are enriched with glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which are tumour cells characterized by their ability to recapitulate the vast heterogeneity of GBM cell phenotypes through propagation and differentia tion 7 . GSCs are often highly refractory to chemo therapy, driving tumour recurrence and chemoresistance 8 . The tumour microenvironment (TME), which contains extracellular matrix (ECM), interstitial fluid and vari ous stromal cells (for example, astrocytes, macro phages and endothelial cells), is a key regulator of tumour progression 9 . Substantial advances have already been made in understanding microenvironmental contribu tions to the progression of other cancers, particularly breast cancer     and pancreatic cancer  15 . Therefore, new therapies have also been developed to target the GBM TME  17 .","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common form of primary brain cancer. Several decades of research have provided great insight into GBM progression; however, the prognosis remains poor, with a median patient survival time of similar to 15 months. The tumour microenvironment (TME) of GBM plays a crucial role in mediating tumour progression and thus is being explored as a therapeutic target. Progress in the development of treatments targeting the TME is currently limited by a lack of model systems that can accurately recreate the distinct extracellular matrix composition and anatomic features of the brain, such as the blood-brain barrier and axonal tracts. Biomaterials can be applied to develop synthetic models of the GBM TME to mimic physiological and pathophysiological features of the brain, including cellular and extracellular matrix composition, mechanical properties and topography. In this Review, we summarize key features of the GBM microenvironment and discuss different strategies for the engineering of GBM TME models, including 2D and 3D models featuring chemical and mechanical gradients, interfaces and fluid flow. Finally, we highlight the potential of engineered TME models as platforms for mechanistic discovery and drug screening, as well as preclinical testing and precision medicine.",https//www.nature.com/articles/s41578-019-0135-y.pdf
6349,A phase II study of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway inhibitor TLN-4601 in patients with glioblastoma at first progression,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults, with an age-adjusted incidence of 3.05 per 100,000 person years in the US  . Despite the incorporation of temozolomide chemotherapy in the initial management of GBM, outcome for patients with this disease remains dismal with progression occurring at a median of 6.9 months following diagnosis and overall survival in the range of 14.9 months  . Therapeutic options following progression are limited in efficacy and essentially palliative, and no standard approach or treatment for recurrent GBM exists.","This phase II trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of TLN-4601 in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) at first progression. TLN-4601 inhibits the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, and in animal models crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in implanted gliomas, possibly by binding specifically to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. A maximum of 40 patients with recurrent GBM were to be enrolled in this study. TLN-4601 was administered at a dose of 480 mg/m(2)/day by continuous intravenous (CIV) administration. Each 21-day cycle consisted of a 14-day CIV administration and a 7-day recovery period. Samples were obtained from all patients for pharmacokinetic evaluations (PK) and for Raf-1 and pERK biomarker assessment using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Following enrollment of 20 patients, this study was terminated due to a lack of efficacy. Of 17 evaluable patients, 14 had MR scans performed after two cycles of TLN-4601. Of these 14 patients, three had stable disease and 11 had disease progression. Only three patients had MR scans performed after four cycles and all had evidence of radiographic progression. Serum PKs confirmed that patients were exposed to TLN-4601 at targeted drug levels. TLN-4601 was generally well tolerated although two patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Biomarker analysis did not show consistent changes. TLN-4601 infused via CIV at 480 mg/m(2)/day for 14 of 21 days is well tolerated by patients with progressive GBM. However, this agent is ineffective in progressive GBM when administered as monotherapy in this schedule.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-011-0747-6.pdf
6371,Factorial Design as a Tool for the Optimization of PLGA Nanoparticles for the Co-Delivery of Temozolomide and O6-Benzylguanine,"Nanomedicine has been arousing increasing interest, since it allows the early diagnosis and monitoring of several diseases and also can increase the efficacy of conventional pharmacological treatments by enabling their controlled delivery     . Several materials have been widely studied for nanoparticles (NPs) development. Among polymeric materials, poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic) (PLGA) is perhaps the most used, due to being FDA-approved, biocompatible, biodegradable, and having tunable physicochemical properties  . Since these polymeric NPs allow the release of drugs in a controlled and sustained manner for long periods, the required drug doses and administration frequency can be minimized, decreasing the toxicity of the encapsulated drug  . Additionally, PLGA NPs are up-taken by endocytic mechanism, circumventing the p-glycoprotein-mediated cellular efflux, enabling drug accumulation in the target cells. Also, since this polymer can be easily functionalized with different materials, the design of NPs with diverse targeting moieties can be achieved  .","Poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely studied for several applications due to their advantageous properties, such as biocompatibility and biodegradability. Therefore, these nanocarriers could be a suitable approach for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) therapy. The treatment of this type of tumours remains a challenge due to intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Thus, new approaches must be envisaged to target GBM tumour cells potentially providing an efficient treatment. Co-delivery of temozolomide (TMZ) and O6-benzylguanine (O6BG), an inhibitor of DNA repair, could provide good therapeutic outcomes. In this work, a fractional factorial design (FFD) was employed to produce an optimal PLGA-based nanoformulation for the co-loading of both molecules, using a reduced number of observations. The developed NPs exhibited optimal physicochemical properties for brain delivery (dimensions below 200 nm and negative zeta potential), high encapsulation efficiencies (EE) for both drugs, and showed a sustained drug release for several days. Therefore, the use of an FFD allowed for the development of a nanoformulation with optimal properties for the co-delivery of TMZ and O6BG to the brain.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/pharmaceutics/pharmaceutics-11-00401/article_deploy/pharmaceutics-11-00401.pdf
6458,Engineered Drug Resistant gamma delta T Cells Kill Glioblastoma Cell Lines during a Chemotherapy Challenge A Strategy for Combining Chemo- and Immunotherapy,"Treatment strategies for high-grade primary brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have failed to significantly and consistently extended survival despite 50 years of advances in radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgical techniques  . Immunotherapy remains an attractive option, although classical approaches that have shown some promise in other malignancies have generally been disappointing when applied to GBM       . A variety of immune cell therapy approaches to GBM have been attempted over the past several years. Ex vivo culture of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from tumor-draining lymph nodes   , tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and HLA-mismatched T cells from healthy donors with systemic and intracranial infusion have all met with limited success. The most predominant cell therapy consisted of autologous lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, a combination of NK and T lymphocytes cultured in high doses of IL-2. Although promising in early studies, these therapies fall short for several reasons. CTL therapies are based on adaptive immunity (i.e. MHC-restricted, antigen-specific responses) and are therefore dependent upon the dose of T cell clones that specifically recognize various tumor-associated peptide antigens dispersed among various subsets of glioma cells. Infusion or intracranial placement of HLA-mismatched CTL relies on allogeneic recognition of transplantation antigens and is highly dependent on glioma cell MHC Class I expression   . LAK cell preparations are difficult to consistently manufacture, are short-lived in vivo  , and are complicated by IL-2 related toxicity once infused or placed in the tumor resection cavity      .","Classical approaches to immunotherapy that show promise in some malignancies have generally been disappointing when applied to high-grade brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We recently showed that ex vivo expanded/activated gamma delta T cells recognize NKG2D ligands expressed on malignant glioma and are cytotoxic to glioma cell lines and primary GBM explants. In addition, gamma delta T cells extend survival and slow tumor progression when administered to immunodeficient mice with intracranial human glioma xenografts. We now show that temozolomide (TMZ), a principal chemotherapeutic agent used to treat GBM, increases the expression of stress-associated NKG2D ligands on TMZ-resistant glioma cells, potentially rendering them vulnerable to gamma delta T cell recognition and lysis. TMZ is also highly toxic to gamma delta T cells, however, and to overcome this cytotoxic effect gamma delta T cells were genetically modified using a lentiviral vector encoding the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) from the O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) cDNA, which confers resistance to TMZ. Genetic modification of gamma delta T cells did not alter their phenotype or their cytotoxicity against GBM target cells. Importantly, gene modified gamma delta T cells showed greater cytotoxicity to two TMZ resistant GBM cell lines, U373(TMZ-R) and SNB-19(TMZ-R) cells, in the presence of TMZ than unmodified cells, suggesting that TMZ exposed more receptors for gamma delta T cell-targeted lysis. Therefore, TMZ resistant gamma delta T cells can be generated without impairing their anti-tumor functions in the presence of high concentrations of TMZ. These results provide a mechanistic basis for combining chemotherapy and gamma delta T cell-based drug resistant cellular immunotherapy to treat GBM.",https//storage.googleapis.com/plos-corpus-prod/10.1371/journal.pone.0051805/1/pone.0051805.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=wombat-sa%40plos-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20210302%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20210302T015605Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=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
6487,Biology of Angiogenesis and Invasion in Glioma,"Glioblastoma remains a uniformly fatal disease, despite advances in surgical and medical therapy. Two major aspects of glioma biology that contributes to this recalcitrance are the formation of new blood vessels through the process of angiogenesis and the invasion of glioma cells through white matter tracts, which are hallmarks of glioblastoma. Due to angiogenesis, the glioma vessel structure is markedly abnormal, resulting in decreased delivery of chemotherapies, increasing tumor hypoxia, and producing edema with its clinical consequences. These abnormal blood vessels in gliomas have also been shown to create a vascular niche that houses glioma stem cells, 1 cells making up a small fraction of the glioma that have been shown to be capable of giving rise to the entire tumor  and which are believed to represent a source of treatment resistance, suggesting that targeting the abnormal glioma vasculature could enable targeting of this glioma stem cell population. Recent insights into the fundamental processes and molecular changes accompanying glioma invasion and angiogene-sis are providing exciting new therapeutic targets to deal with this uniformly fatal disease.","Treatment of adult brain tumors, in particular glioblastoma, remains a significant clinical challenge, despite modest advances in surgical technique, radiation, and chemotherapeutics. The formation of abnormal, dysfunctional tumor vasculature and glioma cell invasion along white matter tracts are believed to be major components of the inability to treat these tumors effectively. Recent insight into the fundamental processes governing glioma angiogenesis and invasion provide a renewed hope for development of novel strategies aimed at reducing the morbidity of this uniformly fatal disease. In this review, we discuss background biology of the blood brain barrier and its pertinence to blood vessel formation and tumor invasion. We will then focus our attention on the biology of glioma angiogenesis and invasion, and the key mediators of these processes. Last, we will briefly discuss recent and ongoing clinical trials targeting mediators of angiogenesis or invasion in glioma patients.

6509,MiR-181b modulates chemosensitivity of glioblastoma multiforme cells to temozolomide by targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a Grade IV brain tumor according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, is one of the most aggressive human cancers   . Current treatments include surgical resection and radio/chemotherapy; however, the median survival remains 12-18 months from time of diagnosis and a nearly 100% local recurrence rate following maximal therapy has been reported   . One of the most common reasons for GBM recurrence is resistance to therapeutic drugs   . Furthermore, treatment of drug resistant-GBM is more difficult because of its limited repair mechanisms and anatomical complexities    . Therefore, it is urgent to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in GBM to develop effective therapeutic interventions.","Temozolomide (TMZ) is a promising chemotherapeutic agent to treat Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, resistance to TMZ develops quickly with a high frequency. The mechanisms underlying GBM cells' resistance to TMZ are not fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate protein expression by cleaving or repressing the translation of target mRNAs. Recently, miRNAs have been discovered to play important roles in drug resistance. A previous study showed that miR-181b in involved in glioma tumorigenesis. Thus, it would be valuable to explore the functions and mechanisms of miR-181b in regulating GMB cells' sensitivity to TMZ. In this study, quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) data indicated that miR-181b was significantly downregulated in recurrent GBM tissues compared with initial GBM tissues. We also found that miR-181b overexpression increased the chemo-sensitivity of GBM cells to TMZ and potentiated TMZ-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was a direct target of miR-181b restoration of EGFR rescued the inhibitory effects of miR-181b and TMZ treatment. Taken together, our data support strongly an important role for miR-181b in conferring TMZ resistance by targeting EGFR expression.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11060-017-2463-3.pdf
6531,Drugs targeting the mitochondrial pore act as citotoxic and cytostatic agents in temozolomide-resistant glioma cells,The obtained data suggest that these pharmacological agents could be selected as adjuvant drugs for the treatment of high grade astrocytomas that resist conventional therapies or that do not show any peculiar genetic alteration that can be targeted by specific drugs.," High grade gliomas are one of the most difficult cancers to treat and despite surgery, radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemotherapy, the prognosis of glioma patients is poor. Resistance to temozolomide is the major barrier to effective therapy. Alternative therapeutic approaches have been shown to be ineffective for the treatment of genetically unselected glioma patients. Thus, novel therapies are needed. Mitochondria-directed chemotherapy is an emerging tool to combat cancer, and inner mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) represents a target for the development of cytotoxic drugs. A number of agents are able to induce MPT and some of them target MPT-pore (MPTP) components that are selectively up-regulated in cancer, making these agents putative cancer cell-specific drugs. The aim of this paper is to report a comprehensive analysis of the effects produced by selected MPT-inducing drugs (Betulinic Acid, Lonidamine, CD437) in a temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma cell line (ADF cells).s EGFRvIII expression has been assayed by RT-PCR. EGFR amplification and PTEN deletion have been assayed by differential-PCR. Drugs effect on cell viability has been tested by crystal violet assay. MPT has been tested by JC1 staining. Drug cytostatic effect has been tested by mitotic index analysis. Drug cytotoxic effect has been tested by calcein AM staining. Apoptosis has been assayed by Hoechst incorporation and Annexine V binding assay. Authophagy has been tested by acridine orange staining. We performed a molecular and genetic characterization of ADF cells and demonstrated that this line does not express the EGFRvIII and does not show EGFR amplification. ADF cells do not show PTEN mutation but differential PCR data indicate a hemizygous deletion of PTEN gene. We analyzed the response of ADF cells to Betulinic Acid, Lonidamine, and CD437. Our data demonstrate that MPT-inducing agents produce concentration-dependent cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in parallel with MPT induction triggered through MPTP. CD437, Lonidamine and Betulinic acid trigger apoptosis as principal death modality. The obtained data suggest that these pharmacological agents could be selected as adjuvant drugs for the treatment of high grade astrocytomas that resist conventional therapies or that do not show any peculiar genetic alteration that can be targeted by specific drugs.",https//translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1479-5876-7-13.pdf
6578,Snail expression contributes to temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), as one of most leading causes of human malignancies, is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor in humans  . The current median survival of GBM is only approximately 14 months  . Up to date, temozolomide (TMZ) is the mainly used oral alkylating agent to treat GBM and astrocytomas   . However, most GBM tumors (up to 50%) are refractory to TMZ therapies, which lead to poor survival of GBM patients  . The adaptive TMZ resistant GBM cells differ from their parent cells at the molecular level. Therefore, better understanding of biological and molecular mechanisms of TMZ resistance is desperately needed.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of most malignancy tumors worldwide. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an important chemotherapy drug in GBM therapy. However, acquired TMZ-resistance frequently happens in GBM therapy and leads to high percentage of GBM recurrence. In our study, we demonstrated that Snail is upregulated in recurrent GBM tumors, and promotes the GBM cells resistant to TMZ induced apoptosis. Enhanced expression of Snail compromises the apoptosis induced by TMZ, and increases the cell migration and invasion. Reversely, depletion of Snail by siRNA has the opposite effects. In addition, we confirmed that the expression of Snail is modulated by STAT3 activation, since phospho-STAT3 level is relatively higher in recurrent GBM tumors and TMZ resistant cells. Knockdown of STAT3 turns down the expression of Snail in protein and mRNA level, and thereby sensitized the resistant GBM cells to TMZ treatment. Interestingly, the activation of STAT3 in GBM resistant cells is modulated by IL-6 secretion. Suppression of IL-6 abandons the STAT3 activation, and reduces its binding with Snail promoter. Inhibition of IL-6 by its antibody enhanced the killing effects of TMZ both in vivo and in vitro. Overall, our results provided a rational to overcome the TMZ resistant in GBM treatment by targeting IL-6-STAT3-Snail pathway.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6684932/pdf/ajtr0011-4277.pdf
6606,Updates of mTOR Inhibitors,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an atypical serine/threonine (S/T) protein kinase, is a central controller of cell growth, proliferation and metabolism   . Cumulative evidence indicates that mTOR acts as a 'master switch' of cellular anabolic and catabolic processes, regulating the rate of cell growth and proliferation by virtue of its ability to sense mitogen, energy and nutrient levels   . Dysregulation of mTOR and other proteins in the signaling pathway often occurs in a variety of human malignant diseases and the tumor cells have shown higher susceptibility to mTOR inhibitors than normal cells. For example, activation of the mTOR pathway was noted in squamous cancers  , adenocarcinomas  , bronchioloalveolar carcinomas  , colorectal cancers  , astrocytomas  and glioblastomas  . A recent immunohistochemical study performed in tissue arrays containing 124 tumors from 8 common human tumor types revealed that approximately 26% of tumors (32/124) are predicted to be sensitive to mTOR inhibition  . These findings indicate a potential role of","Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central controller of cell growth, proliferation, metabolism and angiogenesis. mTOR signaling is often dysregulated in various human diseases and thus attracts great interest in developing drugs that target mTOR. Currently it is known that mTOR functions as two complexes, mTOR complex 1/2 (mTORC1/2). Rapamycin and its analogs (all termed rapalogs) first form a complex with the intracellular receptor FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12) and then bind a domain separated from the catalytic site of mTOR, blocking mTOR function. Rapalogs are selective for mTORC1 and effective as anticancer agents in various preclinical models. In clinical trials, rapalogs have demonstrated efficacy against certain types of cancer. Recently, a new generation of mTOR inhibitors, which compete with ATP in the catalytic site of mTOR and inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with a high degree of selectivity, have been developed. Besides, some natural products, such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, curcumin and resveratrol, have been found to inhibit mTOR as well. Here, we summarize the current findings regarding mTOR signaling pathway and review the updated data about mTOR inhibitors as anticancer agents.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2980558/pdf/nihms234738.pdf

Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme have a median overall survival of 14 to 15 months when treated with a standard regimen of surgery, radiation, and the DNA intercalating agent temozolomide (Temodar; ref.  . Nonselective chemotherapeutics remain the sole drug treatment option for this patient population in large part because recent targeted therapies, such as gefitinib and bevacizumab that block EGFR and VEGF signaling, respectively, have fallen short of expectations     . This realization has fueled a need for novel therapeutics to combat glioblastoma multiforme through a different mechanism of action; however, the development of new glioblastoma multiforme therapeutics is complicated by the necessity for efficient brain penetrance.","Glioblastoma multiforme is a devastating and intractable type of cancer. Current antineoplastic drugs do not improve the median survival of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme beyond 14 to 15 months, in part because the blood-brain barrier is generally impermeable to many therapeutic agents. Drugs that target microtubules (MT) have shown remarkable efficacy in a variety of cancers, yet their use as glioblastoma multiforme treatments has also been hindered by the scarcity of brain-penetrant MT-targeting compounds. We have discovered a new alkylindole compound, ST-11, that acts directly on MTs and rapidly attenuates their rate of assembly. Accordingly, ST-11 arrests glioblastoma multiforme cells in prometaphase and triggers apoptosis. In vivo analyses reveal that unlike current antitubulin agents, ST-11 readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Further investigation in a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of glioblastoma multiforme shows that ST-11 activates caspase-3 in tumors to reduce tumor volume without overt toxicity. Thus, ST-11 represents the first member of a new class of brain-penetrant antitubulin therapeutic agents. (C) 2016 AACR.",https//mct.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanther/15/9/2018.full.pdf
6674,"Etoposide-mediated glioblastoma cell death dependent or independent on the expression of its target, topoisomerase II alpha?","Despite undeniable progress in the care and treatment of primary brain tumors, for most patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) prognosis is poor and few survive more than 3 years. The treatments administered for patients with GBM; surgical removal of all visible tumor to the extent safely possible (gross resection), radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy, have limited eVectiveness, with a median overall survival time of just 15 months. Essentially, all GBM recur after standard treatment of concomitant and adjuvant (maintenance) temozolomide chemotherapy in addition to radiotherapy  . The relapsed lesion is typically refractory to further treatment and invariably leads to patient death. While the management of newly diagnosed GBM with concurrent RT/TMZ therapy remains relatively free of controversy, there is no accepted treatment for patients with recurring tumors after the standard therapy. Second-line or salvage therapies to receive attention in the past 2 years include reexposure to alternative temozolomide scheduling  , targeted therapies such as erlotinib   , imatinib  ) and enzastaurin  and anti-angiogenic agents which include bevacuzimab  and cediranib  . BeneWt for these strategies can be measured in months, despite some treatments showing signiWcant response. There are no randomized clinical trials demonstrating signiWcant overall survival beneWt, and unfortunately, strategies suggesting promise in the phase II setting have failed to show substantiated beneWt in phase III validation trials.","Treatments which significantly improve progression-free and overall survival for patients with relapsed glioblastoma (GBM) after the standard therapy are lacking. The Topoisomerase II (TopoII) enzyme is a key target of anticancer agents because of the important role it plays in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling. A drug with strong topoisomerase-mediated anticancer activity is etoposide that is used in combination with carboplatin in patients with relapsed GBM. We hypothesized that tumors harboring high expression of TopoII alpha (TopoIIa) would be more sensitive to etoposide treatment.The relative expression levels of TopoIIa protein were measured in a panel of GBM cell lines using Western blot analysis and in a cohort of GBM using immunohistochemistry. Expression levels of TopoIIa in the cell lines were correlated with relative sensitivity to treatment with etoposide. To ascertain the role TopoIIa plays in mediating response to etoposide, expression was reduced with a siRNA targeted to TopoIIa.Protein expression of TopoIIa, although high in the cell lines, was very low in patient specimens. Correlations between TopoIIa protein expression and sensitivity to etoposide were evident. The IC(50) for the low-TopoIIa-expressing cell line, T98G, was almost 50 times higher than M059K (high TopoIIa). Inhibition of TopoIIa in MO59K cells with siRNA significantly altered the IC(50), increasing the resistance to etoposide. Interestingly, the expression of TopoIIa was not decreased after treatment with etoposide, indicating other mechanisms underplay treatment response.In vitro, the levels of TopoIIa protein expression correlate with response to etoposide but also multiple molecular events namely DNA-PK and MDR also play a role in cell sensitivity to etoposide. That we did not find a high expression of TopoIIa in clinical specimens further suggests the mechanisms underlying treatment response are complex.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00432-011-1046-5.pdf
6698,Neural Stem Cell-Based Anticancer Gene Therapy A First-in-Human Study in Recurrent High-Grade Glioma Patients,"Human neural stem cells (NSC) have emerged as promising cell-based strategies for treating central nervous system diseases and injury  . Most current strategies aim to use NSCs for regenerative purposes, to replace damaged tissue, stimulate repair, or restore missing enzymes. In contrast, the focus of the NSC-based anticancer strategy described herein is to harness the intrinsic tumor-tropic properties of NSCs and use these cells as delivery vehicles to selectively target therapeutic gene pro-ducts to invasive brain tumor cells. By modifying NSCs to express a prodrug-converting enzyme, potentially higher concentrations of chemotherapy can be selectively produced at tumor sites while minimizing toxicity to normal brain and other tissues in the body."," Human neural stem cells (NSC) are inherently tumor tropic, making them attractive drug delivery vehicles. Toward this goal, we retrovirally transduced an immortalized, clonal NSC line to stably express cytosine deaminase (HB1. F3. CD. C21; CD-NSCs), which converts the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).Experimental Design Recurrent high-grade glioma patients underwent intracranial administration of CD-NSCs during tumor resection or biopsy. Four days later, patients began taking oral 5-FC every 6 hours for 7 days. Study treatment was given only once. A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schema was used to increase doses of CD-NSCs from 1 x 10(7) to 5 x 10(7) and 5-FC from 75 to 150 mg/kg/day. Intracerebral micro-dialysis was performed to measure brain levels of 5-FC and 5-FU. Serial blood samples were obtained to assess systemic drug concentrations as well as to perform immunologic correlative studies. Fifteen patients underwent study treatment. We saw no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) due to the CD-NSCs. There was 1 DLT (grade 3 transaminitis) possibly related to 5-FC. We did not see development of anti-CD-NSC antibodies and did not detect CD-NSCs or replication-competent retrovirus in the systemic circulation. Intracerebral microdialysis revealed that CD-NSCs produced 5-FU locally in the brain in a 5-FC dose-dependent manner. Autopsy data indicate that CD-NSCs migrated to distant tumor sites and were nontumorigenic. Collectively, our results from this first-in-human study demonstrate initial safety and proof of concept regarding the ability of NSCs to target brain tumors and locally produce chemotherapy.

Because glioblastomas are highly vascular tumors, therapies that target angiogenesis have generated substantial interest. In 2009, bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of recurrent glioblastomas based on 2 phase II trials showing improved response rates and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) compared to historical controls.(3,4) However, the benefits of bevacizumab are transient, and tumors progress after a median of only 3-5 months.(3,4) Once tumors progress on bevacizumab, further treatments are of little or no benefit.(5</SUP)",https//n.neurology.org/content/neurology/82/19/1670.full.pdf
6755,Molecular targeting of glioblastoma Drug discovery and therapies,"In the United States, the majority of the estimated 20,000 newly diagnosed primary brain tumors annually are gliomas  , which are named according to the cell type they most closely resemble and likely originated from. The main histological subtypes of gliomas include astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. Astrocytomas are graded from I to IV, with grade I and II as slow growing astrocytomas, grade III as anaplastic astrocytomas and grade IV consisting of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) -the most common (65%) and malignant form of brain tumors. The prognosis of GBM patients is very poor, largely due to early invasion into the central nervous system, making a surgical cure nearly impossible.","Despite advances in treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), patient prognosis remains poor. Although there is growing evidence that molecular targeting could translate into better survival for GBM, current clinical data show limited impact on survival. Recent progress in GBM genomics implicate several activated pathways and numerous mutated genes. This molecular diversity can partially explain therapeutic resistance and several approaches have been postulated to target molecular changes. Furthermore, most drugs are unable to reach effective concentrations within the tumor owing to elevated intratumoral pressure, restrictive vasculature and other limiting factors. Here, we describe the preclinical and clinical developments in treatment strategies of GBM. We review the current clinical trials for GBM and discuss the challenges and future directions of targeted therapies.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4101015/pdf/nihms-269046.pdf
6788,Combined treatment of Nimotuzumab and rapamycin is effective against temozolomide-resistant human gliomas regardless of the EGFR mutation status,"The EGFR signaling system is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. EGFR gene amplification and overexpression account for approximately 40%-60% of GBMs   . In a report by Heimberger and colleagues, 42.6% of GBM patients failed to express EGFR, 25.9% had an overexpression of wtEGFR and 31.5% expressed a specific EGFR mutant (EGFRvIII, also known as EGFR type III, de2-7, ΔEGFR) [ . In a subsequent study, 46% of GBMs lack EGFR  . Of note, EGFRvIII expression in GBM is frequently associated with amplification and co-expression of the wtEGFR  . Elevated levels of EGFR or EGFRvIII expression confer enhanced cell proliferation and invasion  . Given the high frequency of EGFR dysregulation, inhibiting EGFR signaling pathway appears to be a promising and rational therapeutic strategy for attenuating GBM growth."," The treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an unmet clinical need. The 5-year survival rate of patients with GBM is less than 3%. Temozolomide (TMZ) remains the standard first-line treatment regimen for gliomas despite the fact that more than 90% of recurrent gliomas do not respond to TMZ after repeated exposure. We have also independently shown that many of the Asian-derived glioma cell lines and primary cells derived from Singaporean high-grade glioma patients are indeed resistant to TMZ. This issue highlights the need to develop new effective anti-cancer treatment strategies. In a recent study, wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (wtEGFR) has been shown to phosphorylate a truncated EGFR (known as EGFRvIII), leading to the phosphorylation of STAT proteins and progression in gliomagenesis. Despite the fact that combination of EGFR targeting drugs and rapamycin has been used before, the effect of mono-treatment of Nimotuzumab, rapamycin and combination therapy in human glioma expressing different types of EGFR is not well-studied. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy of dual blockage using monoclonal antibody against EGFR (Nimotuzumab) and an mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) in Caucasian patient-derived human glioma cell lines, Asian patient-derived human glioma cell lines, primary glioma cells derived from the Mayo GBM xenografts, and primary short-term glioma culture derived from high-grade glioma patients.s The combination effect of Nimotuzumab and rapamycin was examined in a series of primary human glioma cell lines and glioma cell lines. The cell viability was compared to TMZ treatment alone. Endogenous expressions of EGFR in various GBM cells were determined by western blotting. The results showed that combination of Nimotuzumab with rapamycin significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of human glioma cells compared to single treatment. More importantly, many of the Asian patient-derived glioma cell lines and primary cells derived from Singaporean high-grade gliomas, which showed resistance to TMZ, were susceptible to the combined treatments. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that combination usage of Nimotuzumab and rapamycin exert higher cytotoxic activities than TMZ. Our data suggest that this combination may provide an alternative treatment for TMZ-resistant gliomas regardless of the EGFR status.",https//bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12885-015-1191-3.pdf
6811,Combination of sublethal concentrations of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor and microtubule stabilizer induces apoptosis of glioblastoma cells,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent malignant neoplasm of the human central nervous system. Surgery can only control the highly proliferative component of the disease, whereas widespread tumor cell infiltration into normal brain areas resists radiotherapy and chemotherapy   . Amplification and overexpression of the gene encoding the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) are detected in f50% of glioblastomas and are mainly associated with disease progression   . EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases  . Small molecular weight compounds with EGFR protein kinase inhibitory (PKI) activity, such as PKI-166 or AEE788, have a cytostatic effect in vitro on tumor cells that overexpress EGFR   . In addition, treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer with the EGFR PKI imatinib (gefitinib) resulted in tumor growth control in 10% of patients  . In fact, tumors that responded to gefitinib specifically carried specific mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain  . Although responses to gefitinib have also been observed in a limited number of glioblastoma cases  , a specific molecular profile is associated with response that differs from the lung signature  . To date, several small molecular weight inhibitors, such as Gleevec or erlotinib/gefinitib, applied as monotherapies for the treatment of gliomas, only resulted in limited effectiveness  . This has supported the hypothesis that combination of drugs would be a more appropriate treatment for glioma.","The oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway triggers downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/RAS-mediated signaling cascades. In transgenic mice, glioblastoma cannot develop on single but only on simultaneous activation of the EGFR signaling mediators RAS and AKT. However, complete blockade of EGFR activation does not result in apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells, suggesting additional cross-talk between downstream pathways. Based on these observations, we investigated combination therapies using protein kinase inhibitors against EGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and mammalian target of rapamycin, assessing glioblastoma cell survival. Clinically relevant doses of AEE788, Gleevec (imatinib), and RAD001 (everolimus), alone or in combinations, did not induce glioblastoma cell apoptosis. In contrast, simultaneous inactivation of the EGFR downstream targets mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase and PI3K by U0126 and wortmannin triggered rapid tumor cell death. Blocking EGFR with AEE788 in combination with sublethal concentrations of the microtubule stabilizer patupilone also induced apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation in glioblastoma cells, accompanied by reduced AKT and ERK activity. These data underline the critical role of the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase/ERK signaling cascades in the cell-intrinsic survival program of sensitive glioblastoma cell lines. We conclude that drug combinations, which down-regulate both ERK and protein kinase B/AKT activity, may prove effective in overcoming cell resistance in a subgroup of glioblastoma.",https//mct.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanther/6/2/773.full.pdf
6839,Dopamine Receptor D5 is a Modulator of Tumor Response to Dopamine Receptor D2 Antagonism,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are the largest superfamily of membrane receptors in humans. However, these receptors are underexploited therapeutic targets for oncology that control several signaling pathways that are critical for cancer, including the integrated stress response and Ras signaling  . Overexpression of the GPCR dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) in cancer and anticancer effects of DRD2 antagonism via induction of the integrated stress response and inhibition of Akt/ERK signaling have been reported in a range of tumor types     ."," Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) is a G protein-coupled receptor antagonized by ONC201, an anticancer small molecule in clinical trials for high-grade gliomas and other malignancies. DRD5 is a dopamine receptor family member that opposes DRD2 signaling. We investigated the expression of these dopamine receptors in cancer and their influence on tumor cell sensitivity to ONC201.Experimental Design The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to determine DRD2/DRD5 expression broadly across human cancers. Cell viability assays were performed with ONC201 in >1,000 Genomic of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and NCI60 cell lines. IHC staining of DRD2/DRD5 was performed on tissue microarrays and archival tumor tissues of glioblastoma patients treated with ONC201. Whole exome sequencing was performed in RKO cells with and without acquired ONC201 resistance. Wild-type and mutant DRD5 constructs were generated for overexpression studies. DRD2 overexpression broadly occurs across tumor types and is associated with a poor prognosis. Whole exome sequencing of cancer cells with acquired resistance to ONC201 revealed a de novo Q366R mutation in the DRD5 gene. Expression of Q366R DRD5 was sufficient to induce tumor cell apoptosis, consistent with a gain-of-function. DRD5 overexpression in glioblastoma cells enhanced DRD2/DRD5 heterodimers and DRD5 expression was inversely correlated with innate tumor cell sensitivity to ONC201. Investigation of archival tumor samples from patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with ONC201 revealed that low DRD5 expression was associated with relatively superior clinical outcomes. These results implicate DRD5 as a negative regulator of DRD2 signaling and tumor sensitivity to ONC201 DRD2 antagonism.",https//clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/25/7/2305.full.pdf
6873,Pericytes in Glioblastomas Multifaceted Role Within Tumor Microenvironments and Potential for Therapeutic Interventions,"GBM is the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain cancer with a dismal prognosis   . The median overall survival rate is currently 20.8 months for patients undergoing treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy (temozolomide) following maximum safe resection  . It is estimated that about 13,000 patients are newly diagnosed with GBM annually with an estimated 5-year survival rate of about 10% for adults and about 40% for children    .","Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and lethal disease that often results in a poor prognosis. Unlike most solid tumors, GBM is characterized by diffuse infiltrating margins, extensive angiogenesis, hypoxia, necrosis, and clonal heterogeneity. Recurrent disease is an unavoidable consequence for many patients as standard treatment options such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have proven to be insufficient in causing long-term survival benefits. Systemic delivery of promising drugs is hindered due to the blood-brain barrier and non-uniform perfusion within GBM tissue. In recent years, many investigations have highlighted the role of GBM stem cells (GSCs) and their microenvironment in the initiation and maintenance of tumor tissue. Preclinical and early clinical studies to target GSCs and microenvironmental components are currently underway. Of these strategies, immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and redirected cytotoxic T cells have shown promising results in early investigations. But, GBM microenvironment is heterogenous and recent investigations have shown cell populations within this microenvironment to be plastic. These studies underline the importance of identifying the role of and targeting multiple cell populations within the GBM microenvironment which could have a synergistic effect when combined with novel therapies. Pericytes are multipotent perivascular cells that play a vital role within the GBM microenvironment by assisting in tumor initiation, survival, and progression. Due to their role in regulating the blood-brain barrier permeability, promoting angiogenesis, tumor growth, clearing extracellular matrix for infiltrating GBM cells and in helping GBM cells evade immune surveillance, pericytes could be ideal therapeutic targets for stymieing or exploiting their role within the GBM microenvironment. This chapter will introduce hallmarks of GBM and elaborate on the contributions of pericytes to these hallmarks by examining recent findings. In addition, the chapter also highlights the therapeutic value of targeting pericytes, while discussing conventional and novel GBM therapies and obstacles to their efficacy.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-16908-4_2.pdf
6928,The role of glioma stem cells in chemotherapy resistance and glioblastoma multiforme recurrence,"Gliomas are primary brain tumors that are derived from genetic alterations in neural stem cells or neural progenitor cells. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), they are classified into four grades of ascending malignancy  . The higher the tumor grade, the poorer is the overall prognosis. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), or grade IV glioma, is the most common type of primary malignant brain tumor, accounting for 55% of all cases  ( Figure 1 ). Even after gold-standard treatment with successful tumor resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (temozolomide), the tumor always recurs, resulting in a very poor outcome. The median survival only reaches up to 18 months and approximately 30% of patients achieve 2-year survival   . Massive research has been applied for discovery of new molecular targets to stop therapy resistance and GBM recurrence. However, currently available therapies have only a palliative effect.","Glioma stem cells (GSCs) constitute a slow-dividing, small population within a heterogeneous glioblastoma. They are able to self-renew, recapitulate a whole tumor, and differentiate into other specific glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) subpopulations. Therefore, they have been held responsible for malignant relapse after primary standard therapy and the poor prognosis of recurrent GBM. The failure of current therapies to eliminate specific GSC subpopulations has been considered a major factor contributing to the inevitable recurrence in GBM patients after treatment. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance of GSCs and the reasons why complete eradication of GSCs is so difficult to achieve. We will also describe the targeted therapies currently available for GSCs and possible mechanisms to overcome such chemoresistance and avoid therapeutic relapse.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4830899/pdf/nihms-775239.pdf
6963,Longitudinal heterogeneity in glioblastoma moving targets in recurrent versus primary tumors,"In an effort to personalize medicine, target-specific treatment has increasingly been applied in most fields of oncology over the past decade yielding unprecedented benefit on drug response and survival times     . A broad range of specific drugs has already been established in the field, starting from earliest investigation in clinical trials leading to routine clinical application (Additional file 1 Table S1 ). Molecularly targeted-therapy is also considered as a rational approach in neurooncology due to the presence of specific molecular alterations that are associated with typical changes in, e.g., glioma-associated signaling pathways     . One example for successfully targeted therapy in brain tumors is the recent trial of everolimus for treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients that characteristically have an overactivated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase due to mutations of TSC1/2 genes and subsequent altered activity of the TSC-gene products. Everolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR, has antiproliferative efficacy in these patients  . By contrast, literally every targeting effort directed towards the most malignant and most frequent primary brain tumor, i.e. glioblastoma (GBM) has failed in the past  . Not a single target-specific compound could be shown to be superior to the already limited efficacy of alkylating chemotherapies        . The inability of drugs and compounds to cross the blood-brain-barrier and the fact that most of these agents were tested on unselected patient populations, which had not been stratified according to the molecular treatment target (e.g. gene alteration, transmembrane protein etc.) may partly explain these disappointing results. Noteworthy, targeted therapy approaches had been tested to a surprising degree in patient populations suffering from recurrent GBM. This seems particularly challenging, as target gene expression status are not routinely assessed at the time of disease relapse-due to the fact that most patients are not eligible for re-surgery. Clearly, treatment decisions in this setting must be based on the assumption that the target expression status is maintained during the course of disease, that is throughout primary therapy until tumor progression occurs several months later. The maintenance of a hallmark biomarker, the epigenetic status of O 6 -methyl-guanine-methyltransferase (MGMT) promotor methylation, has respectively been described in primary vs. recurrent GBM tissue  . More recent work, however, has begun to highlight shifting genomic/mutational and methylome profiles under the influence of primary treatment schedules in GBM   , which coincides with the accumulation of discouraging data from clinical trials applying molecular targeted compounds."," Molecularly targeted therapies using receptor inhibitors, small molecules or monoclonal antibodies are routinely applied in oncology. Verification of target expression should be mandatory prior to initiation of therapy, yet, determining the expression status is most challenging in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) where most patients are not eligible for second-line surgery. Because very little is known on the consistency of expression along the clinical course we here explored common drug targets in paired primary vs. recurrent GBM tissue samples.s Paired surgical tissue samples were derived from a homogeneously treated cohort of 34 GBM patients. All patients received radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. Verification of common drug targets included immunohistological analysis of PDGFR-beta, FGFR-2, FGFR-3, and mTOR-pathway component (phospho-mTOR(Ser2448)) as well as molecular, MLPA-based analysis of specific copy number aberrations at the gene loci of ALK, PDGFRA, VEGFR2/KDR, EGFR, MET, and FGFR1. Paired tumor tissue exhibited significant changes of expression in 9 of the 10 investigated druggable targets (90%). Only one target (FGFR1) was found ""unchanged"", since dissimilar expression was observed in only one of the 34 paired tumor tissue samples. All other targets were variably expressed with an 18-56% discordance rate between primary and recurrent tissue. The high incidence of dissimilar target expression status in clinical samples from primary vs. recurrent GBM suggests clinically relevant heterogeneity along the course of disease. Molecular target expression, as determined at primary diagnosis, may not necessarily present rational treatment clues for the clinical care of recurrent GBM. Further studies need to analyze the therapeutic impact of longitudinal heterogeneity in GBM.",https//translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12967-019-1846-y.pdf

This review summarizes findings, discusses problems and defines new questions from the phase III trials on anaplastic gliomas. The molecular subgroup analyses of the NOA-04 trial identified three molecular parameters, which predict longer progression-free and overall survival independent from the mode of therapy, radiotherapy or alkylating chemotherapy-. These are 1p/19q codeletion, methylation of the promoter of the O(6)-methylguanyl methyltransferase (MGMT) gene and hot-spot mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene. The prognostic relevance of these markers is not lower than that of histopathological subclassification but determination is potentially more robust. Therefore, marker profiles should be included into the next WHO brain tumor classification. The current standard of care for first-line treatment in anaplastic gliomas is radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The next steps, e.g. within the international CATNON trial, are to define the role and optimal sequencing of combined modality treatment focusing on radiotherapy and temozolomide. Inclusion in this trial is already based on the WHO grade and the 1p/19q status and not on the histopathological subtype. Furthermore, anaplastic gliomas are an important group of brain tumors for developing future molecular targeted therapies and should therefore be in the main focus of academic and industrial drug development, which aims at improved efficacy and avoiding long-term side-effects.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00115-010-2956-1.pdf
7003,Bevacizumab Reduces Permeability and Concurrent Temozolomide Delivery in a Subset of Patients with Recurrent Glioblastoma,"The dependence of tumor growth on angiogenesis has provided a powerful rationale for antiangiogenic approaches to cancer therapy  . Targeting blood vessels in glioblastoma (GBM) has been a particularly attractive strategy given the characteristic high degree of endothelial proliferation, hyperpermeability, and proangiogenic growth factor expression (e.g., VEGF) associated with this solid tumor   . The approval of bevacizumab, which neutralizes VEGF, in December 2017 for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) represented the first new therapy for this disease in years. However, no study in GBM has shown improved overall survival in unselected patients when combining bevacizumab or other antiangiogenic therapies with concomitant chemotherapy or radiation and the reasons for this are unclear    ."," Targeting tumor blood vessels is an attractive therapy in glioblastoma (GBM), but the mechanism of action of these agents and how they modulate delivery of concomitant chemotherapy are not clear in humans. We sought to elucidate how bevacizumab modulates tumor vasculature and the impact those vascular changes have on drug delivery in patients with recurrent GBM.Experimental Design Temozolomide was labeled with [11C], and serial PET-MRI scans were performed in patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab and daily temozolomide. PET-MRI scans were performed prior to the first bevacizumab dose, 1 day after the first dose, and prior to the third dose of bevacizumab. We calculated tumor volume, vascular permeability (K-trans), perfusion (cerebral blood flow), and the standardized uptake values (SUV) of [11C] temozolomide within the tumor. Twelve patients were enrolled, resulting in 23 evaluable scans. Within the entire contrast-enhancing tumor volume, both temozolomide uptake and vascular permeability decreased after initiation of bevacizumab in most patients, whereas change in perfusion was more variable. In subregions of the tumor where permeability was low and the blood-brain barrier not compromised, increased perfusion correlated with increased temozolomide uptake. Bevacizumab led to a decrease in permeability and concomitant delivery of temozolomide. However, in subregions of the tumor where permeability was low, increased perfusion improved delivery of temozolomide, suggesting that perfusion may modulate the delivery of chemotherapy in certain settings. These results support exploring whether lower doses of bevacizumab improve perfusion and concomitant drug delivery.",https//clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/26/1/206.full.pdf
7025,Fenofibrate-induced nuclear translocation of FoxO3A triggers Bim-mediated apoptosis in glioblastoma cells in vitro,"Despite recent advances in cancer therapy, there is an enormous need for new therapeutic approaches against CNS malignances. Recent reports suggest a beneficial role for lipid-lowering drugs, fibrates and statins in anticancer treatment.        For example, a ten-year mortality study of over 7,722 French subjects treated with different fibrates revealed that the use of these drugs is associated with a significantly lower total mortality and reduced probability of death from cancer.

7052,Intertumoral heterogeneity in patient-specific drug sensitivities in treatment-naive glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating form of cancer. Unselected patients have a median survival time of less than one year, which increases to~15 months in patients eligible for surgery, radiation and chemotherapy  . Despite a range of therapeutic approaches, little improvement has been gained over the recent decades  .","A major barrier to effective treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) is the large intertumoral heterogeneity at the genetic and cellular level. In early phase clinical trials, patient heterogeneity in response to therapy is commonly observed; however, how tumor heterogeneity is reflected in individual drug sensitivities in the treatment-naive glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) is unclear.sWe cultured 12 patient-derived primary GBMs as tumorspheres and validated tumor stem cell properties by functional assays. Using automated high-throughput screening (HTS), we evaluated sensitivity to 461 anticancer drugs in a collection covering most FDA-approved anticancer drugs and investigational compounds with a broad range of molecular targets. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA and Spearman correlation.Although tumor stem cell properties were confirmed in GSC cultures, their in vitro and in vivo morphology and behavior displayed considerable tumor-to-tumor variability. Drug screening revealed significant differences in the sensitivity to anticancer drugs (p<0.0001). The patient-specific vulnerabilities to anticancer drugs displayed a heterogeneous pattern. They represented a variety of mechanistic drug classes, including apoptotic modulators, conventional chemotherapies, and inhibitors of histone deacetylases, heat shock proteins, proteasomes and different kinases. However, the individual GSC cultures displayed high biological consistency in drug sensitivity patterns within a class of drugs. An independent laboratory confirmed individual drug responses.This study demonstrates that patient-derived and treatment-naive GSC cultures maintain patient-specific traits and display intertumoral heterogeneity in drug sensitivity to anticancer drugs. The heterogeneity in patient-specific drug responses highlights the difficulty in applying targeted treatment strategies at the population level to GBM patients. However, HTS can be applied to uncover patient-specific drug sensitivities for functional precision medicine.",https//bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12885-019-5861-4.pdf
7082,Blockade of Glioma Proliferation Through Allosteric Inhibition of JAK2,"Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Grade IV glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive form, with a median survival of about 12 months after aggressive treatment with surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy  . Although malignant gliomas display genetic heterogeneity, common molecular alterations are often found within specific signal transduction pathways. The genes encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a constitutively activated mutant, called EGFR variant 3 (EGFRvIII), are frequently overexpressed in human GBM  . Both EGFR and EGFRvIII strongly promote gliomagenesis and are promising potential targets for therapy.","The gene that encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed or mutated in human cancers, including glioblastoma. However, the efficacy of EGFR-targeted small-molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies in glioblastomas that also have mutation or deletion of the gene encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has been modest. We found that EGFR signaling was blocked by a small molecule (G5-7) that selectively inhibited Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-mediated phosphorylation and activation of EGFR and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) by binding to JAK2, thereby decreasing the activity of downstream signaling by mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and inducing cell cycle arrest. G5-7 inhibited the proliferation of PTEN-deficient glioblastoma cell lines harboring a constitutively active variant of EGFR (U87MG/EGFRvIII) and human glioblastoma explant neurosphere cultures, but the drug only weakly inhibited the proliferation of either glioblastoma cell lines that were wild type for EGFR and stably transfected with PTEN (U87MG/PTEN) or normal neural progenitor cells and astrocytes. Additionally, G5-7 reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and endothelial cell migration and induced apoptosis in glioblastoma xenografts, thereby suppressing glioblastoma growth in vivo. Furthermore, G5-7 was more potent than EGFR or JAK2 inhibitors that interfere with either ligand or adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) binding at impeding glioblastoma cell proliferation, demonstrating that this allosteric JAK2 inhibitor may be an effective clinical strategy.",https//stke.sciencemag.org/content/sigtrans/6/283/ra55.full.pdf
7133,Intracerebral infusate distribution by convection-enhanced delivery in humans with malignant gliomas Descriptive effects of target anatomy and catheter positioning,"alignant gliomas (MGs) remain rapidly and almost uniformly fatal despite existing therapeutic modalities  . One reason for this is that the blood-brain barrier and high intratumoral pressure severely limit the penetration of drugs delivered systemically into brain parenchyma infiltrated by neoplastic cells       . Existing techniques of regional drug delivery, such as impregnated polymer discs or bolus injection, are also limited because they are dependant on diffusion to distribute the therapeutic agent beyond the site of drug deposition. Drug distribution by diffusion is dependant on a concentration gradient, inversely related to the molec-ular weight of the agent, and usually slow relative to tissue clearance. This results, therefore, in an inhomogeneous distribution of the drug with steep concentration gradients between the point of delivery and the infiltrative tumor border   . Thus, the need for developing and optimizing drug delivery systems that are capable of targeting infiltrating neoplastic cells that have migrated significant distances beyond the contrast-enhancing tumor region cannot be overemphasized     .","OBJECTIVE Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) holds tremendous potential for drug delivery to the brain. However, little is known about the volume of distribution achieved within human brain tissue or how target anatomy and catheter positioning influence drug distribution. The primary objective of this study was to quantitatively describe the distribution of a high molecular weight agent by CED relative to target anatomy and catheter position in patients with malignant gliomas.METHODS Seven adult patients with recurrent malignant gliomas underwent intracerebral infusion of the tumor-targeted cytotoxin, cintredekin besudotox, concurrently with I-123-labeled human serum albumin. High-resolution single-photon emission computed tomographic images were obtained at 24 and 48 hours and were coregistered with magnetic resonance imaging scans. The distribution of I-123-labeled human serum albumin relative to target anatomy and catheter position was analyzed.RESULTS Intracerebral CED infusions were well-tolerated and some resulted in a broad distribution of I-123-labeled human serum albumin, but target anatomy and catheter positioning had a significant influence on infusate distribution even within non-contrast-enhancing areas of brain. Intratumoral infusions were anisotropic and resulted in limited coverage of the enhancing tumor area and adjacent peritumoral regions.CONCLUSIONS CED has the potential to deliver high molecular weight agents into tumor-infiltrated brain parenchyma with volumes of distribution that are clinically relevant. Target tissue anatomy and catheter position are critical parameters in optimizing drug delivery.",https//watermark.silverchair.com/ons-60-suppl_2-ons-89.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAuAwggLcBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggLNMIICyQIBADCCAsIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMKxRQoQVNxwT05-CgAgEQgIICk0gn9zf31E4_ZpB403b2zwFVo717sP8UOi-nIHtAfkjcncnphg_m5mzzMELBt6xDGfCuhanXf5qRv7g3UAhjzqwKoJq_WRipBjHxrnc-xGF8iL_dGbubsZBjDjOzrDiatuHpU_k9UF7Uex-nYivM76zFN9aAnB9CuNXVhFGagNS4lF6p94U2ZQ8TmwtnfG7XK_x4fSDHPQeUKEWALujth2oSXu7WPMnqONp5RwKdU1kFD0JGjQs5bV78tEYENgxCnnpcQfLmU9JC0KxbledFyu_H5pD-p0W30VSSPfqLNUOW4ppRZSX5EgaJ257sMdmO04gUZ2bqxTWAkt4BCpLUHGrwmtpj8vAJU36jjSIlWz2LCbuQ7hblkrN7R4FVmg-2BvWkO5yqxfuAHQdBbQUI581pq0W5mbc7E6OXORupgY-jqm39D-qRGYSbbzSnEhXj2mb6NJ_3NV0Z3G2JlTovx2iGXxtjJnvioxd5rTtP4hI8YIHnEhSmG2C4CCrW-dwcPG6x36jY2HZYlYDyVNsEqJzTj30i8Dk82geCtiA_N4BXr0KUwx_xvz61qNX5RgBDt-vRYEdsnBH8Q69Pdi49te0PIBaUROJ-_7fAIsJsTGiZDOipCXf_jDfYK8t59kdgLoAM_LvJfDSk-SdvJH6kxsVgxnOMPMkANeSdzpGsAjz1aLM3gnA760tXoo2pR7DYdhlkgc6SZG5pwIYYrSFXq5hPRaddkx-2yKXOdZCrDcflJsBZk6A6_VH2oN_jKUTWUTx9bVGGKlejith8bk4rOIihQKPr5ZvWGmawMT_H3GicL-UCkr7u60-Jfg9D6AqDA8h47qWN7r2XP6cDdYrrk8Ngv9qdoQuPQCmxuSbOL7dGYdbu

The median survival time from diagnosis is approximately 1 year, even in patients who undergo aggressive treatment   . For patients with recurrent glioblastoma, salvage therapies have been of limited value historically. However, recent studies have shown that therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or its cognate receptor (VEGFR), can achieve durable antitumor beneWt in some patients with recurrent malignant glioma       . Based on these Wndings, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, accelerated approval for patients with recurrent glioblastoma based on durable radiographic response    . Compared with historical benchmarks, however, only modest improvements in OS were noted in these studies. Nonetheless, rationally designed combinatorial strategies may further enhance the antitumor ben-eWt of VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapeutics and show an improvement in OS      .","Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) play a significant role in glioblastoma angiogenesis and proliferation, making tyrosine kinase (TK) receptors logical targets for treatment.

A dose-expansion phase stratified patients by surgical eligibility. Primary objectives were to determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose; secondary objectives included evaluating (1) safety/tolerability, (2) pharmacokinetics, and (3) preliminary antitumor activity.Sixty-four glioblastoma patients were enrolled. Two Group A patients experienced DLTs (proteinuria and stomatitis) at 550 mg; 550 mg was, therefore, the highest dose evaluated and dose limiting. One Group B patient receiving 800 mg experienced a DLT (diarrhea). The initially recommended dose for dose-expansion phase for Group A was 400 mg; additional patients received 250 mg to assess the hepatotoxicity. Most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea and rash. Serious AEs, most commonly grade 3/4 liver function test elevations, were responsible for treatment discontinuation in 17% of patients. AEE788 concentrations were reduced by EIACD. The best overall response was stable disease (17%).Continuous, once-daily AEE788 was associated with unacceptable toxicity and minimal activity for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.

Despite standard therapy including surgery, chemoand radiotherapy have been widely adopted, the average survival time is only about 15 months, whereas the 5-year survival rate is only 4-5%,    Irrespective of the current aggressive and multi-model first-line approaches of diagnosis and treatment, recurrence of glioblastoma (GBM) is practically inevitable, with an average time of recurrence is less than 10 months. ,    Various treatments modalities are utilized, including repeat resection, irradiation, and systemic agents; however, the prognosis for these patients remains discouraging. The need for more innovative therapeutic strategies to expedite recurrent glioma therapeutics is imperative."," Postoperative recurrence is the main reason for poor clinical outcomes in glioma patients, so preventing tumor recurrence is crucial in the management of gliomas.s In this study, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in normal tissues was detected via RNA-seq analysis. Glioma cases from the public databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA)) were included in this study. The hydrogel contains minocycline (Mino) and vorinostat (Vor) (G/Mino+Vor) was formed under 365 nm when the photoinitiator was added. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess the release of drugs in the G/Mino+Vor hydrogel. An MTT assay was used to explore the biosecurity of GelMA. Immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and TUNEL assays were used to demonstrate the antitumor effect of the G/Mino+Vor hydrogel. We successfully developed a G/Mino+Vor hydrogel. The experiments in vitro and in vivo confirmed the MMPs-responsive delivery of minocycline and vorinostat in hydrogel and the anti-glioma effect on an incomplete tumor operation model, which indicated that the G/Mino+Vor hydrogel effectively inhibited the recurrence of glioma after surgery.

7245,Anti-VEGF treatment reduces blood supply and increases tumor cell invasion in glioblastoma,"Bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is a promising, yet controversial, drug in human glioblastoma treatment (GBM). Its effects on tumor burden, recurrence, and vascular physiology are unclear. We therefore determined the tumor response to bevacizumab at the phenotypic, physiological, and molecular level in a clinically relevant intracranial GBM xenograft model derived from patient tumor spheroids. Using anatomical and physiological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we show that bevacizumab causes a strong decrease in contrast enhancement while having only a marginal effect on tumor growth. Interestingly, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI revealed a significant reduction of the vascular supply, as evidenced by a decrease in intratumoral blood flow and volume and, at the morphological level, by a strong reduction of large-and medium-sized blood vessels. Electron microscopy revealed fewer mitochondria in the treated tumor cells. Importantly, this was accompanied by a 68% increase in infiltrating tumor cells in the brain parenchyma. At the molecular level we observed an increase in lactate and alanine metabolites, together with an induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and an activation of the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase pathway. These data strongly suggest that vascular remodeling induced by anti-VEGF treatment leads to a more hypoxic tumor microenvironment. This favors a metabolic change in the tumor cells toward glycolysis, which leads to enhanced tumor cell invasion into the normal brain. The present work underlines the need to combine anti-angiogenic treatment in GBMs with drugs targeting specific signaling or metabolic pathways linked to the glycolytic phenotype.","Bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is a promising, yet controversial, drug in human glioblastoma treatment (GBM).

7287,Advances in Molecular Imaging of Locally Delivered Targeted Therapeutics for Central Nervous System Tumors,"Neuroimaging and grading of central nervous system (CNS) and, specifically, brain tumors has evolved from a purely anatomy-based discipline as per the World Health Organization (WHO) classification (which merely relied on the basis of histological features and almost entirely on microscopic visual assessment of tumor bio-specimen)  to one that incorporates morphologic abnormality with physiologic alterations in extracellular compartment kinetics, cellular metabolism, and hemodynamics  . The WHO classification scheme of brain tumors remains the primary basis for managing therapy and evaluating overall prognosis in patients with brain tumors. The current diagnostic approaches fall short of predicting therapeutic response of individual tumors and cannot provide precise guidance for therapy, especially for those targeting specific molecular or genetic pathways of tumorigenesis  . Despite these shortcomings, the most recent WHO classification (2016 revision) started taking into account these molecular mechanisms. This work, however, is still at a germinal phase.","Thanks to the recent advances in the development of chemotherapeutics, the morbidity and mortality of many cancers has decreased significantly. However, compared to oncology in general, the field of neuro-oncology has lagged behind. While new molecularly targeted chemotherapeutics have emerged, the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) renders systemic delivery of these clinical agents suboptimal. To circumvent the BBB, novel routes of administration are being applied in the clinic, ranging from intra-arterial infusion and direct infusion into the target tissue (convection enhanced delivery (CED)) to the use of focused ultrasound to temporarily disrupt the BBB. However, the current system depends on a wait-and-see approach, whereby drug delivery is deemed successful only when a specific clinical outcome is observed. The shortcomings of this approach are evident, as a failed delivery that needs immediate refinement cannot be observed and corrected. In response to this problem, new theranostic agents, compounds with both imaging and therapeutic potential, are being developed, paving the way for improved and monitored delivery to central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. In this review, we focus on the advances and the challenges to improve early cancer detection, selection of targeted therapy, and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, brought forth by the development of these new agents.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/ijms/ijms-18-00351/article_deploy/ijms-18-00351.pdf

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor. It is a rapidly progressive, highly recurrent, fatal intracranial neoplasm, and the demand for novel treatment is urgent. Valproic acid (VPA) is a potential anticancer agent that belongs to a class of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, targeting the epigenetic control of gene functions in cancer cells. This drug has been administered for the prevention or treatment of seizure disorder in GBM patients; therefore, a retrospective analysis may further our understanding of the effect of VPA on GBM patients. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of 102 patients with GBM was conducted to study the effects of VPA on disease outcome. Tumor samples from seven patients receiving VPA treatment between the first and second operations were obtained in order to verify the HDAC inhibitory activity of VPA in these patients. . In univariate analysis, administration of VPA within 2 weeks of initial diagnosis seemed to confer a survival benefit. However, stratified analysis according to chemotherapy showed that VPA did not have significant impact on the GBM patients' overall survival. Analysis of tissue samples from these patients revealed that a small subset of patients had increased histone acetylation after VPA treatment. . VPA treatment, when administered according to a protocol targeting seizure control, may result in HDAC inhibition in a small subset of patients, but does not significantly affect overall patient survival. Early administration of VPA as an adjunct to temozolomide chemotherapy may have its merits, but the optimal dosing schedule and target serum level require further investigation.",https//www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/02688697.2011.638996?needAccess=true

Despite considerable scientific and technological progress, the treatment of GB remains a major challenge.","Anticancer agents that target both tumor cells and angiogenesis are of potential interest for glioblastoma (GB) therapy. One such agent is sorafenib (SFN), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, poor aqueous solubility and undesirable side effects limit its clinical application, including local treatment. We encapsulated SFN in lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) to overcome these drawbacks. LNCs are nanocarriers formulated according to a solvent-free process, using only components that have received regulatory approval. SFN-LNCs had a diameter of 54 +/- 1 nm, high encapsulation efficiency (> 90%), and a drug payload of 2.11 +/- 0.03 mg/g of LNC dispersion. They inhibited in vitro angiogenesis and decreased human U87MG GB cell viability similarly to free SFN. In vivo studies showed that the intratumoral administration of SFN-LNCs or free SFN in nude mice bearing an orthotopic U87MG human GB xenograft decreased the proportion of proliferating cells in the tumor relative to control groups. SFN-LNCs were more effective than free SFN for inducing early tumor vascular normalization, characterized by increases in tumor blood flow and decreases in tumor vessel area.

The treatment for GBM includes surgery, radiotherapy and, Temozolomide (TMZ) or Bevacizumab (Avastin ® )  . In a recent report, Bevacizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor A, has been reported to have little improvement as compared to the standard treatment and, with a worse quality of life for the patients  .","Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most common and lethal adult primary tumor of the brain, showed a link between Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway in the resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). PTCH1, the SHH receptor, can tonically represses signaling by endocytosis. We asked how the decrease in PTCH1 in GBM cells could lead to TMZ-resistance. TMZ resistant GBM cells have increased PTCH1 mRNA and reduced protein. Knockdown of Dicer, a Type III RNAase, indicated that miRNAs can explain the decreased PTCH1 in TMZ resistant cells. Computational studies, real-time PCR, reporter gene studies, western blots, target protector oligos and ectopic expression identified miR-9 as the target of PTCH1 in resistant GBM cells with concomitant activation of SHH signaling. MiR-9 mediated increases in the drug efflux transporters, MDR1 and ABCG2. MiR-9 was increased in the tissues from GBM patients and in an early passage GBM cell line from a patient with recurrent GBM but not from a naive patient. Pharmacological inhibition of SHH signaling sensitized the GBM cells to TMZ. Taken together, miR-9 targets PTCH1 in GBM cells by a SHH-independent method in GBM cells for TMZ resistance.

7488,The Role of Wnt Signal in Glioblastoma Development and Progression A Possible New Pharmacological Target for the Therapy of This Tumor,"The Wnt pathway is currently recognized as an important regulatory signal able to influence developmental embryonic processes  and to modulate self-renewal, maintenance and differentiation of adult tissue stem cells   . About three decades ago, it was discovered that the proto-oncogene Int-1 caused the malignant transformation of mouse mammary tissue, once activated by insertion of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Moreover, Int-1 resulted to be a homolog of Drosophila wingless (wg), which in turn controls segment polarity during larval development  . Thus, the gene was named Wnt1 (wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 1).","Wnt is a complex signaling pathway involved in the regulation of crucial biological functions such as development, proliferation, differentiation and migration of cells, mainly stem cells, which are virtually present in all embryonic and adult tissues. Conversely, dysregulation of Wnt signal is implicated in development/progression/invasiveness of different kinds of tumors, wherein a certain number of multipotent cells, namely cancer stem cells, are characterized by high self-renewal and aggressiveness. Hence, the pharmacological modulation of Wnt pathway could be of particular interest, especially in tumors for which the current standard therapy results to be unsuccessful. This might be the case of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most lethal, aggressive and recurrent brain cancers, probably due to the presence of highly malignant GBM stem cells (GSCs) as well as to a dysregulation of Wnt system. By examining the most recent literature, here we point out several factors in the Wnt pathway that are altered in human GBM and derived GSCs, as well as new molecular strategies or experimental drugs able to modulate/inhibit aberrant Wnt signal. Altogether, these aspects serve to emphasize the existence of alternative pharmacological targets that may be useful to develop novel therapies for GBM.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/genes/genes-09-00105/article_deploy/genes-09-00105-v2.pdf

The EORTC Brain Tumor Group (BTG) has contributed significantly to these clinical developments  . Future trials will also incorporate the new molecular findings in their design and scientific questions.","The EORTC Brain Tumor Group (BTG) is dedicated to clinical research of neoplasms of the brain. In the past years the BTG has carried out phase II and phase III trials on glial tumors, brain metastases and primary CNS lymphomas. Future studies will investigate novel drugs in combination with chemo-radiotherapy in glioblastoma multiforme, radiotherapy in meningioma, and chemotherapy in medulloblastoma. The BTG will also start a new phase III trial on newly diagnosed low-grade glioma comparing radiotherapy to temozolomide. In all our trials translational research is getting more and more important, often this is one of the most important ways to get useful conclusions from clinical trials.

7549,Convection-enhanced delivery for the treatment of glioblastoma,"Effective treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and most malignant glioma, represents one of the most formidable challenges in oncology. Despite the use of extensive surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with GBM remains poor, with a median survival of  -5 months.  Following recurrence, salvage treatment provides only about 6 -8 months of additional survival.  It is the infiltrative nature of these tumors that eliminates the possibility of curative surgical resection. Even at the time of initial presentation, there is infiltration of tumor cells that extend at least  cm away from the radiographical contrastenhancing mass.  Efforts to treat this residual disease with conventional and targeted chemotherapies delivered via oral or intravenous routes have been rendered minimally effective by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the partially functional blood-tumor-barrier, which prevent the effective delivery of potentially active chemotherapeutic compounds.  Strategies have been investigated for enhancing drug delivery to brain tumor cells by methods that do not rely on the circulatory system. These techniques circumvent the BBB completely in order to improve drug delivery to the brain parenchyma. Furthermore, these intraparenchymal delivery approaches result in locally high, but systemically low, concentrations of chemotherapies known to have activity against gliomas, thereby eliminating the systemic toxicity that has limited their dosing. Direct intraparenchymal delivery also provides a means for delivering newer, tumor-selective molecules that are often largely excluded from the CNS.  ","Effective treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) remains a formidable challenge. Survival rates remain poor despite decades of clinical trials of conventional and novel, biologically targeted therapeutics. There is considerable evidence that most of these therapeutics do not reach their targets in the brain when administered via conventional routes (intravenous or oral). Hence, direct delivery of therapeutics to the brain and to brain tumors is an active area of investigation. One of these techniques, convection-enhanced delivery (CED), involves the implantation of catheters through which conventional and novel therapeutic formulations can be delivered using continuous, low-positive-pressure bulk flow. Investigation in preclinical and clinical settings has demonstrated that CED can produce effective delivery of therapeutics to substantial volumes of brain and brain tumor. However, limitations in catheter technology and imaging of delivery have prevented this technique from being reliable and reproducible, and the only completed phase III study in GBM did not show a survival benefit for patients treated with an investigational therapeutic delivered via CED. Further development of CED is ongoing, with novel catheter designs and imaging approaches that may allow CED to become a more effective therapeutic delivery technique.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4483037/pdf/nou354.pdf
7561,Analysis of Biodistribution of Intracranially Infused Radio labeled Interleukin-13 Receptor-Targeted Immunotoxin IL-13PE by SPECT/CT in an Orthotopic Mouse Model of Human Glioma,"Recur rent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains challenging to treat because of its diffuse and infiltrative nature, its cytologic heterogeneity, and the inability to adequately deliver drugs at therapeutic doses. Despite treatment with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, prognosis remains poor, particularly for GBM, with a median survival of less than 1 y at initial diagnosis and 6-8 mo after recurrence or progression  . To target GBM without damaging adjacent normal tissue and achieve therapeutic concentrations of the drug, locoregional delivery methods such as convection-enhanced delivery (CED) or biodegradable polymer implantation have been developed and shown promising results in preclinical studies and early phase clinical trials   . CED relies on a continuous pressure gradient to administer a therapeutic agent directly into the interstitial space of the brain over a few days to bypass the blood-brain barrier and increase drug distribution to the target tissue. Despite the appeal of delivering therapy directly to the site of disease, many phase 2 and 3 clinical trials using CED for GBM have failed to achieve endpoint objectives partly due to uncertainties of drug delivery to the entire tumor   .","Interleukin-13 Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL-13PE), a targeted agent for interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13R alpha 2)-expressing tumors, has been administered intracranially by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) for glioma therapy in several clinical trials including a randomized phase 3 clinical trial. However, its intracranial distribution was not optimally evaluated. We investigated the intracranial distribution of radiolabeled IL-13PE after CED in a murine model of glioblastoma multiforme. s IL-13PE was radiolabeled with (NaI)-I-125 and evaluated for its activity in vitro in receptor-positive U251 or -negative T98G human glioma cell lines. Gliomas were grown in nude mice after intracranial implantation with U251 cells, and I-125-IL-13PE was stereotactically administered by bolus or CED for 3 d, followed by micro-SPECT/CT imaging. SPECT images were evaluated quantitatively and compared with histology and autoradiography results.  The radioiodination technique resulted in a specific and biologically active I-125-IL-13PE, which bound and was cytotoxic to IL-13R alpha 2-positive but not to IL-13R alpha 2-negative tumor cells. Both the binding and the cytotoxic activities were blocked by a 100-fold excess of IL-13, which indicated the specificity of binding and cytotoxicity. SPECT/CT imaging revealed retention of I-125-IL-13PE administered by CED in U251 tumors and showed significantly higher volumes of distribution and maintained detectable drug levels for a longer period of time than the bolus route. These results were confirmed by autoradiography.  IL-13PE can be radioiodinated without the loss of specificity, binding, or cytotoxic activity. Intracranial CEO administration produces a higher volume of distribution for a longer period of time than,the bolus route. Thus, CED of IL-13PE is superior to bolus injection in delivering the drug to the entire tumor.",https//jnm.snmjournals.org/content/jnumed/55/8/1323.full.pdf
7599,Advances in drug development for targeted therapies for glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is the most malignant brain tumor and occurs frequently in the central nervous system.  In the USA, the annual incidence of glioblastoma is ./00 000 population, and glioblastoma accounts for 4 .% of all primary brain tumors and 4.% of malignant brain tumors.  The incidence increases with age and is the highest for elderly adults aged  to 4 years.  Following diagnosis, the -year survival rate of patients with glioblastoma (.%) is much worse than patients with other malignant brain tumors  .  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, glioblastoma is the most malignant grade IV glioma.  Two types of glioblastoma are defined by the origins of the tumors primary glioblastoma, which arises de novo as a malignant high-grade glioma (HGG) and accounts for more than 0% of all tumors, and secondary glioblastoma (<0%), which usually develops from a previously established low-grade glioma.  Four subtypes of glioblastoma have been identified according to the molecular expression patterns classical, neural, proneural, and mesenchymal subtypes.   The specific molecular characteristics of the four subtypes of glioblastoma were revealed in comprehensive genomic studies by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program.  Methylation of the O ()-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is one of the most widely studied prognostic biomarkers of glioblastoma  and can improve the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma who are treated with temozolomide (TMZ). MGMT promoter methylation inhibits the transcription of the MGMT gene, which has important functions in the DNA repair process, thus promoting tumor cell death and subsequently improving the beneficial effects of alkylating agents such as TMZ on patients.  Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase  (IDH) gene, such as IDH (RH), frequently occur in glioblastoma and are usually considered another prognostic marker for the survival of patients with glioblastoma. IDH mutations sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy and TMZ, thus prolonging the survival of patients with glioblastoma.  Mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene promoter are also a crucial prognostic factor for glioblastoma, but predict poor treatment response in patients. 0,  With the recent rapid development of next-generation sequencing technology, many studies have been conducted to explore the genomic landscape of glioblastoma. ,  A TCGA Research Network study involved a comprehensive study of more than 00 glioblastoma tumors at the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels. This multidimensional dataset revealed the most frequent genomic characteristics of glioblastoma tumors.  The whole-exome sequencing results in this study identified the most significantly mutated genes or genomic loci, including the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), tumor protein p (TP), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphatidylinositol--bisphosphate -kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIKCA), phosphoinositide--kinase regulatory subunit  (PIKR), neurofibromin  (NF), retinoblastoma  (RB), isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP[+])  (IDH), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) genes; chromosome  (containing the EGFR, MET, and cyclin-dependent kinase ","Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. The prognosis of patients with primary glioblastoma treated with the current standard of care, tumor resection followed by radiation therapy and auxiliary temozolomide, remains poor. Integrative genomic analyses have identified essential core signaling pathways and frequent genetic aberrations, which provide potential drug targets for glioblastoma treatment. Drugs against these therapeutic targets have been developed rapidly in recent years. Although some have shown promising effects on models in preclinical studies, many have shown only modest efficacy in clinical trials. New therapeutic strategies and potent drugs are urgently needed to improve the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma. The goal of this review is to summarize the current advances in drug development for targeted glioblastoma therapies and to reveal the major challenges encountered in clinical trials or treatment. This study will provide new perspectives for future studies of targeted therapeutic drug development and provide insights into the clinical treatment of glioblastoma.",https//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/med.21676?download=true
7634,Convection-enhanced delivery of interleukin-13 receptor-directed cytotoxin for malignant glioma therapy,"Malignant glioma including glioblastoma is diagnosed in approximately 17,000 patients annually in the US alone and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the age range of 15-34 years (1). Despite vigorous efforts of treatment using multimodality approaches, median survival remains dismal (12-15 months from the diagnosis), particularly in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). There are several reasons why those tumors cannot be cured. The first reason is lack of identification of a tumor-associated target, which is selectively present on tumor cells but not on normal brain. The second reason is the existence of blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents the passage of therapeutic macromolecules due to tight junction of endothelial cells, leading to the low accumulation in the brain (3). The third reason is the diffuse infiltrative nature of tumor. Although surgical resection of tumor is performed on the basis of boundaries of tumor defined by CT or MRI, infiltration of tumor in surrounding tissues makes it very difficult if not impossible to distinguish the tumor boundary and to remove completely. Furthermore, heterogeneity of tumor cells also limits the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","The treatment of patients with malignant brain tumors, in particular glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is very challenging because of their diffuse infiltrative nature and the cytological heterogeneity. The median survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM is only 12-15 months, and only 8-12% of them survive for two years. Novel approaches for brain tumor therapy are needed. Recently, targeted therapies have emerged as promising modality for cancer targeting. We have discovered that high affinity plasma membrane receptor for interleukin-13 (IL-13), an immune regulatory cytokine, is over-expressed in 60-80% of malignant brain tumors. To target these IL-13R, we generated a chimeric fusion protein, composed of human IL-13 and mutated Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), termed IL-13 cytotoxin (1L-13-PE), and tested its cytotoxicity to IL-13R-expressing GBM cells. IL-13 cytotoxin was highly potent and selective in killing IL-13R-expressing GBM cells. In contrast, normal cells including brain, immune, and endothelial cells were generally not affected by this cytotoxin due to no or low expression of IL-13R. In vivo pre-clinical studies for safety and toxicity were also performed in mice, rats, and monkeys, and IL-13 cytotoxin was found to be well tolerated by both systemic and intracerebral administrations. IL-13 cytotoxin was found to mediate remarkable efficacy in animal models of human brain tumors. Encouraged by these pre-clinical studies, four Phase 1/2 clinical trials in adult patients with recurrent malignant glioma have been completed. These clinical trials involved convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of IL-13 cytotoxin either intratumoral or intraparenchymal after resection of tumor. CED is a novel loco-regional drug delivery method for intracranial tumors that relies on a continuous pressure gradient to distribute drug into interstitial space. This route of IL-13 cytotoxin administration appears to be very well tolerated and have a good risk-benefit profile. Most recently, a randomized controlled Phase 3 clinical trial (PRECISE) with intraparenchymal IL-13 cytotoxin administration was completed and subjects are being monitored for safety and survival.",https//journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153303460600500307
7667,"Characterization of ABBV-221, a Tumor-Selective EGFR-Targeting Antibody Drug Conjugate","The important role of the EGFR in tumor cell survival makes it an attractive therapeutic target, and both small molecules and antibodies directed against this receptor are approved for clinical use    . Despite the success of these therapeutics, intrinsic and acquired resistance limits their effectiveness  . In principle, EGFR-targeted antibody drug conjugates (ADC) that rely on target expression and not on inhibition of downstream signaling pathways for activity could circumvent some of these resistance mechanisms of current EGFR inhibitors and be more broadly active. Widespread normal tissue EGFR expression, however, represents a toxicity risk  .","Depatuxizumab mafodotin (depatux-m, ABT-414) is a tumor-selective antibody drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of the anti-EGFR antibody ABT-806 and the monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) warhead. Depatux-m has demonstrated promising clinical activity in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials in first-line and recurrent GBM disease settings. Depatux-m responses have been restricted to patients with amplified EGFR, highlighting the need for therapies with activity against tumors with nonamplified EGFR overexpression. In addition, depatux-m dosing has been limited by corneal side effects common to MMAF conjugates. We hypothesized that a monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) ADC utilizing an EGFR-targeting antibody with increased affinity may have broader utility against tumors with more modest EGFR overexpression while mitigating the risk of corneal side effects. We describe here preclinical characterization of ABBV-221, an EGFR-targeting ADC comprised of an affinity-matured ABT-806 conjugated to MMAE. ABBV-221 binds to a similar EGFR epitope as depatux-m and retains tumor selectivity with increased binding to EGFR-positive tumor cells and greater in vitro potency. ABBV-221 displays increased tumor uptake and antitumor activity against wild-type EGFR-positive xenografts with a greatly reduced incidence of corneal side effects relative to depatux-m. ABBV-221 has similar activity as depatux-m against an EGFR-amplified GBM patient derived xenograft (PDX) model and is highly effective alone and in combination with standard-of-care temozolomide in an EGFRvIII-positive GBM xenograft model. Based on these results, ABBV-221 has advanced to a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors associated with elevated levels of EGFR.

7707,MicroRNA-195 reverses the resistance to temozolomide through targeting cyclin E1 in glioma cells,"Glioma is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system, with a high recurrence rate, a high disability rate, and a high mortality rate. In highgrade glioma [glioblastoma (GBM)], the median survival is only 12-15 months and the 5-year survival rate is less than 3%   . Chemotherapy is the most common method for the treatment of glioma and it can kill residual tumor cells, prevent tumor recurrence, and prolong the survival time of patients with glioma. Oral alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) is the best first-line chemotherapy drug for the treatment of primary and recurrent glioma  , which plays an antitumor role depending on its ability to alkylate/methylate DNA, through acting on the cell cycle G1/S and interference DNA replication, to induce apoptosis and death of tumor cells. Like other chemotherapy drugs, some glioma patients are resistant to TMZ already at diagnosis (primary resistance), whereas others may develop TMZ resistance during treatment (acquired resistance). TMZ resistance leads to increased drug doses and adverse reactions, prolonging the chemotherapy cycle, and also adversely affects the survival and the quality of life of patients with gliomas. Therefore, TMZ resistance is a major obstacle toward achievement of better survival in the treatment of this disease. It is very important to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of TMZ resistance to improve the clinical benefit and the survival of glioma patients.","Glioma is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system with poor survival. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the first-line chemotherapy drug for initial and recurrent glioma treatment with a relatively good efficacy, which exerts its antitumor effects mainly through cell death induced by DNA double-strand breaks in the G1 and S phases. However, endogenous or acquired resistance to TMZ limits glioma patients' clinical outcome and is also an important cause of glioma replase. MicroRNA-195 (miR-195) plays an important role in the regulation of G1-phase/S-phase transition, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis of tumor cells. We found that miR-195 expression was significantly decreased in TMZ-resistant glioma cells induced with TMZ and correlated to the resistance index negatively. Also, the exogenous expression of miR-195 reversed TMZ resistance and induced the apoptosis of TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cells. Further bioinformatics analysis showed cyclin E1 (CCNE1) was a potential target gene of miR-195. Knockdown of CCNE1 partially reversed the effect of decreased miR-195 on TMZ resistance. The data from The Cancer Genome Atlas - Cancer Genome further suggested that hsa-miR-195 could negatively regulate the expression of CCNE1 in glioma. In conclusion, miR-195 reverses the resistance to TMZ by targeting CCNE1 in glioma cells and it could act as a potential target for treatment in glioma with TMZ resistance.

7737,Pharmacokinetic profile of temsirolimus with concomitant administration of cytochrome p450-inducing medications,"C ytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes play a major role in the detoxification and biotransformation processes. Among these, the CYP3A4 isoenzyme catalyzes the metabolism of a wide variety of therapeutic agents.  2 Drugs that induce CYP3A activity include rifampin and agents such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital/primidone.    Coadministration of CYP3A inducers with other therapeutic agents that are substrates for CYP3A may decrease circulating substrate concentrations and result in suboptimal efficacy.     Temsirolimus (CCI-779) is a novel selective inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates cell growth and proliferation by controlling translation of cell cycle regulatory proteins.  6 In addition, mTOR upregulates expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and HIF target genes, including the proangiogenesis factor vascular endothelial growth factor.  8 Temsirolimus is in clinical development for the treatment of various malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma.       Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of temsirolimus in cancer patients are established.     Various rapamycin analogs, including tacrolimus and everolimus, exhibit CYP3A-mediated drug interactions.    In vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes indicate that sirolimus is an equally potent metabolite of temsirolimus and is present in the circulation to an appreciable amount relative to the parent drug.     Both temsirolimus and sirolimus are metabolized by the CYP3A isoenzymes. Chemical structures of temsirolimus and sirolimus are shown in Figure 1 . Because temsirolimus and sirolimus are both substrates for CYP3A, the potential exists for clinically significant metabolic drug interactions with coadministered CYP3A inducers. A phase I PK study of temsirolimus in patients with recurrent malignant glioma who were taking enzyme inducers provided initial clinical evidence suggesting the potential for drug interaction. 22 We investigated the effect of concomitant CYP3A inducers on the PK parameters of temsirolimus and sirolimus in 2 separate studies. The first study explored and compared the pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors who were taking enzyme inducers and those who were not taking enzyme inducers. The second study, conducted in healthy adults, defined the effect of rifampin coadministration on temsirolimus PK profiles after a single IV or oral dose of temsirolimus.","Temsirolimus is a novel inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, with antitumor activity in advanced tumors. Because temsirolimus and its metabolite, sirolimus, are cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 substrates, the potential exists for interaction with drugs that induce CYP3A activity, including enzyme inducers and rifampin. Cancer patients received once-weekly intravenous (IV) 220 mg/m(2) temsirolimus with or without enzyme inducers. Coadministration with enzyme inducers decreased temsirolimus maximum plasma concentration (C-max) by 36% and increased volume of distribution by 99%. Sirolimus C-max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were decreased by 67% and 43%, respectively. In healthy adult subjects, coadministration of 25-mg intravenous temsirolimus with rifampin had no significant effect on temsirolimus C-max and AUC but decreased sirolimus Cm and AUC by 65% and 56%, respectively. Rifampin decreased AUC(sum) by 41%. Temsirolimus was well tolerated in both studies. If concomitant agents with CYP3A induction potential are used, higher temsirolimus doses may be needed to achieve adequate tumor tissue drug levels.",https//accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1177/0091270007306957?download=true

Aim To analyze the percentage of survival and mortality of patients with glioblastoma multiforme in a cohort of patients in Chile and to correlate the chemo-resistance of these cells with the expression level of multiple drug resistance transporters. Materials and s Eighteen biopsies of glioblastoma multiforme were obtained from patients at the Institute of Neurosurgery Dr. Asenjo (INCA). The tumor cells were obtained from primary cultures and the expression and activity of multiple drug resistance transporters was assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Population-based study was performed using the databases of the Department of Neurosurgery of INCA.  The number of patients with glioblastoma multiforme increased between 2007 and 2009, from 3.5% to 7.9% of total brain tumors. Mortality of these tumors is 90 % at three years. A high expression and activity of the multiple drugs resistance associated protein 1 (Mrp1) transporter was observed in primary cultures of biopsies.  We propose that Mrp1 activity is responsible for the chemo-resistance of the glioblastoma multiforme and inhibition of this transporter could represent a plausible strategy for the treatment.

The BBTB starts to form at the later stage of glioma and resides among the brain tumor cells and microvessels    , both of which limit the penetration of conventional intravenous or oral drugs into the tumor tissue.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is a type of tumor that is highly lethal despite maximal therapy. Standard therapeutic approaches provide modest improvement in progression-free and overall survival, necessitating the investigation of novel therapies. Oncologic therapy has recently experienced a rapid evolution toward ""targeted therapy"", with drugs directed against specific targets which play essential roles in the proliferation, survival, and invasiveness of GBM cells, including numerous molecules involved in signal transduction pathways.

7858,Targeted Doxorubicin Delivery to Brain Tumors via Minicells Proof of Principle Using Dogs with Spontaneously Occurring Tumors as a Model,"tumor responses characterized by remission in three dogs for more than two years. The median overall survival was 264 days (range 49 to 973). No adverse clinical, hematological or biochemical effects were observed with repeated administration of EGFR minicells Dox (30 to 98 doses administered in 10 of the 17 dogs).","Cytotoxic chemotherapy can be very effective for the treatment of cancer but toxicity on normal tissues often limits patient tolerance and often causes long-term adverse effects. The objective of this study was to assist in the preclinical development of using modified, non-living bacterially-derived minicells to deliver the potent chemotherapeutic doxorubicin via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting. Specifically, this study sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EGFR targeted, doxorubicin loaded minicells (designated (EGFR)minicells(Dox)) to deliver doxorubicin to spontaneous brain tumors in 17 companion dogs; a comparative oncology model of human brain cancers.ology/Principle Findings(EGFR)minicells(Dox) were administered weekly via intravenous injection to 17 dogs with late-stage brain cancers. Biodistribution was assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Anti-tumor response was determined using MRI, and blood samples were subject to toxicology (hematology, biochemistry) and inflammatory marker analysis. Targeted, doxorubicin-loaded minicells rapidly localized to the core of brain tumors. Complete resolution or marked tumor regression (>90% reduction in tumor volume) were observed in 23.53% of the cohort, with lasting anti-tumor responses characterized by remission in three dogs for more than two years. The median overall survival was 264 days (range 49 to 973). No adverse clinical, hematological or biochemical effects were observed with repeated administration of (EGFR)minicells(Dox) (30 to 98 doses administered in 10 of the 17 dogs)./SignificanceTargeted minicells loaded with doxorubicin were safely administered to dogs with late stage brain cancer and clinical activity was observed. These findings demonstrate the strong potential for clinical applications of targeted, doxorubicin-loaded minicells for the effective treatment of patients with brain cancer.

7912,Pan-Cancer Analysis Reveals the Diverse Landscape of Novel Sense and Antisense Fusion Transcripts,"Genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer, leads to the accumulation of dynamic changes in the genome manifested as structural variants (SVs) that include quantitative (copy number variations [CNVs]), positional (translocations), or orientational (inversions) rearrangements. Fusion genes, frequently observed in cancer, are the consequences of such structural rearrangements of the genome resulting in the concatenation of two different genes or gene fragments. Fusion transcripts that originate from fusion genes are likely unique to a cancer type, which can be exploited to understand the underlying mechanisms of malignancy and can serve as effective diagnostic or prognostic markers.   These chimeras could contribute to oncogenicity by altering the expression of tumor suppressor or proto-oncogenes, or by modifying the original function of a protein resulting in an abnormal chimeric protein that stimulates tumorigenesis. Examples of established cancer-specific biomarkers include the nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma tyrosine kinase (NPM-ALK) fusion transcript for the identification of NPM-ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and BCR-ABL1 fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia.   Chimeric genes have also been used for molecular subtyping of cancers, leading to the development of precisely targeted interventions, including heterogeneous cancers such as prostate cancer.  Also, cancer-specific fusions can serve as ideal therapeutic targets leading to effective treatment strategies. Dasatinib, imatinib, and ponatinib are drugs that target the fusion gene BCR-ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia.   Although fusion transcripts in cancer resulting from chromosomal aberrations were identified more than six decades ago,   recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have helped to advance this field immensely. Although fusions were initially found to be more prevalent in liquid cancers, later they were discovered to be prominent in solid tumors.   Furthermore, fusion transcripts were initially assumed to be exclusive to cancer cells, but several reports identified a large number of fusion transcripts in non-cancerous cells, 1,  suggesting that they are prevalent in normal cells as well. Another less explored area is the concept of the transcriptionally induced fusions resulting from a spin-off of transcriptional deregulation, including read-through transcription of neighboring genes or cis-splicing or trans-splicing events. [1] [1]  [1]  This notion expands the space for a large number of fusion transcripts that were earlier unexplored due to the lack of supporting evidence at the structural variation level in the genome. Finally, evidence of natural antisense transcript (NAT) expression for at least % of the annotated transcripts in the cancer genome further adds to the pool of unexplored fusions containing antisense transcripts.  The advances in NGS technologies have fueled the prospects of discovering therapeutically actionable fusion transcripts in cancer cells, leading to the development of a plethora of algorithms to detect fusions from both genomic and transcriptomic sequences.   [2] Most of the popular fusion detection algorithms rely on the alignment of NGS reads to the reference transcriptome, 2 2 but they do not compensate for the extensive perturbations in the transcriptomes resulting from structural variations prevalent in the cancer genomes. This alignment technique potentially misses several true fusion events due to poor alignment of reads from the perturbed cancer transcriptome to the reference sequences. Of the several algorithms available for identifying fusion transcripts from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), a novel alignment-free algorithm, ChimeRScope, developed recently by our group, performed superiorly compared to other popular tools with higher specificity and sensitivity. 1 ChimeRScope employs short k-mer-based unique transcript fingerprints to serve as a reference to match with k-mers from cancer transcriptome reads and identify fusion transcripts in cancer cells that harbor frequent chromosomal abnormalities and mutations.","Gene fusions that contribute to oncogenicity can be explored for identifying cancer biomarkers and potential drug targets. To investigate the nature and distribution of fusion transcripts in cancer, we examined the transcriptome data of about 9,000 primary tumors from 33 different cancers in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) along with cell line data from CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia) using ChimeRScope, a novel fusion detection algorithm. We identified several fusions with sense (canonical, 39%) or antisense (non-canonical, 61%) transcripts recurrent across cancers. The majority of the recurrent non-canonical fusions found in our study are novel, unexplored, and exhibited highly variable profiles across cancers, with breast cancer and glioblastoma having the highest and lowest rates, respectively. Overall, 4,344 recurrent fusions were identified from TCGA in this study, of which 70% were novel. Additional analysis of 802 tumor-derived cell line transcriptome data across 20 cancers revealed significant variability in recurrent fusion profiles between primary tumors and corresponding cell lines. A subset of canonical and non-canonical fusions was validated by examining the structural variation evidence in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data or by Sanger sequencing of fusion junctions. Several recurrent fusion genes identified in our study show promise for drug repurposing in basket trials and present opportunities for mechanistic studies.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7044684/pdf/main.pdf

8010,Molecularly targeted therapy for malignant glioma,"A n estimated ,500 cases of primary malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors were diagnosed in the United States in 2005.  Malignant gliomas are the most common primary CNS tumors in adults accounting for % of all primary malignant CNS tumors. Astrocytomas are the most common type of gliomas. The World Health Organization (WHO) classified astrocytomas into 4 grades according to histopathology. Malignant astrocytomas refer to WHO grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma; AA) and IV (glioblastoma multiforme; GBM). The median survival of patients with AA is 2- years and that of GBM is only 9-2 months.  Favorable prognostic factors include young age, absent or minimal neurological signs, complete surgical resection, and good performance status. The current standard treatments for malignant gliomas include surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. When feasible, maximal surgical resection of tumor improves survival. Until recently, radiation has been the main standard-of-care treatment with a minimal role for systemic chemotherapy. However, in a recent phase  study, Stupp et al reported that adjunctive chemotherapy (concurrent temozolomide with radiation followed by  months of monthly temozolomide) improves median survival by 2.5 months compared with radiation therapy alone.  Thus, temozolomide has become a standard adjuvant therapy for malignant gliomas. Despite this multimodality treatment, clinical recurrence or progression is nearly universal. Intracavitary carmustine wafer implantation in surgically resectable cases of recurrent GBM provided only an -week survival benefit.  Available systemic chemotherapies offer modest clinical benefit with a -month progressionfree survival (PFS) of <5% for GBM and % for AA.  The median overall survival is 25 weeks for recurrent GBM and weeks for recurrent AA.  Taken together, novel therapies for these devastating tumors remain an unmet need. In this article, we will examine the current understanding of molecular abnormalities associated with aberrant signal transduction pathways underlying malignant glioma pathogenesis and how to target these abnormalities with novel therapeutics. We regret that limited space will prevent a complete discussion of all relevant therapies and clinical trials.","Malignant gliomas are relatively uncommon but lethal cancers. Despite recent research efforts in cancer therapy, the prognosis of patients with malignant glio-* mas has remained dismal. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of glioma may lead to a rational development of new therapies. Despite the genetic heterogeneity of malignant gliomas, common aberrations in the signaling elements of the growth and survival pathways are found. New treatments have emerged to target molecules in these signaling pathways with the goal to increase specific efficacy and minimize toxicity. Monoclonal antibodies and low molecular-weight kinase inhibitors are the most common classes of agents in targeted cancer treatment. Most clinical trials of these agents as monotherapies have failed to demonstrate survival benefit in unselected malignant glioma patient populations. Several mechanisms of treatment failure have been demonstrated. In response, multitargeted kinase inhibitors and combinations of single-targeted kinase inhibitors have been developed to overcome therapeutic resistance. In addition, multimodality combinations of targeted agents with radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy/ vaccines may enhance treatment efficacy. Future development of these agents will require advances in discovery and validation of new molecular targets, improvement of therapeutic delivery, and identification of correlative biomarkers. Novel clinical trial designs and endpoints may increase the efficiency of new drug evaluation.

They include WHO Grade III gliomas (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and malignant glioma) as well as Grade IV (glioblastoma). They are the most common and most malignant primary brain tumors and are associated with high morbidity and mortality  . Of these, glioblastoma is the most common and accounts for 48.3% of all gliomas as well as 14.6% of all primary brain tumors  .

Here, we present a novel Phase I clinical trial design addressing several factors plaguing effective treatment of high-grade gliomas (HGG). Study Design This 2-part, ascending-dose, Phase I clinical trial will enroll patients with recurrent/progressive HGG requiring a clinically indicated resection. In Study Part 1, patients will undergo stereotactic tumor biopsy followed by placement of a purpose-built catheter which will be used for the intratumoral, convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of OS2966.

8113,Evaluation of a bispecific biological drug designed to simultaneously target glioblastoma and its neovasculature in the brain,"creasing targeting capability. We and other investigators have examined the feasibility of targeting toxins with dual ligands.    These BLTs have increased antitumor activity as compared with their monospecific counterparts or a mixture of the two, indicating an advantage in including both ligands on the same single-chain molecule.    In the present study, we designed a unique type of BLT capable of simultaneously targeting the cancer cell and its developing neovasculature.","Object. The authors of this study aimed to genetically design a bispecific targeted toxin that would simultaneously target overexpressed markers on glioma as well as the tumor vasculature, to mutate certain amino acids to reduce the immunogenicity of this new drug. and to determine whether the drug was able to effectively reduce aggressive human brain tumors in a rat xenograft model via a novel hollow fiber (HF) catheter delivery system.s. A new bispecific ligand-directed toxin (BLT) was created in which 2 human cytokines-epidermal growth factor ([EGF], targeting overexpressed EGF receptor) and amino acid terminal fragment ([ATF], targeting urokinase plasminogen activator receptor)-were cloned onto the same single-chain molecule with truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin with a terminal lysyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-leucine (KDEL) sequence. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to mutate amino acids in 7 key epitopic toxin regions that dictate the B cell generation of neutralizing antitoxin antibodies to deimmunize the drug. now called ""EGFATFKDEL 7mut."" Bioassays were used to determine whether mutation reduced the drug's potency. and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies were performed to determine whether antitoxin antibodies were decreased. Aggressive brain tumors were intracranially established in nude rats by using human U87 glioma genetically marked with a firefly luciferase reporter gene (U87-luc), and the rats were stereotactically treated with 2 intracranial injections of deimmunized EGFATFKDEL via convection-enhanced delivery (CED). Drug was administered through a novel HF; catheter to reduce drug backflow upon delivery.. In vitro. EGFATFKDEL 7mut selectively killed the human glioblastoma cell line U87-luc as well as cultured human endothelial cells in the form of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Deimmunization did not reduce drug activity. In vivo. when rats with brain tumors were intracranially treated with drug via CED and a novel HE catheter to reduce backflow, there were significant tumor reductions in 2 experiments (p < 0.01). Some rats survived with a tumor-free status until 130 days post-tumor inoculation. An irrelevant BLT control did not protect establishing specificity. The maximal tolerated dose of EGFATFKDEL 7mut was established at 2 mu g/injection or 8.0 mu g/kg, and data indicated that this dose was nontoxic. Antitoxin antibodies were reduced by at least 90%.. First, data indicated that the BLT framework is effective for simultaneously; targeting glioma and its neovasculatnre. Second, in the rodent CED studies, newly developed HE catheters that limit backflow are effective for drug delivery. Third, by mutating critical amino acids, the authors reduced the threat of the interference of neutralizing antibodies that are generated against the drug.

8144,Astrocytes and Glutamine Synthetase in Epileptogenesis,"time-consuming, and associated with a significant drop-out rate. Second, such studies need to be low-risk-that is, minimally invasive and observational. Highly invasive and informative approaches such as neuropathological evaluations of brain tissue, are only possible in subsets of patients with epilepsy, in conjunction with epilepsy surgery or analysis of tissue obtained at autopsy. Third, while the use of laboratory animals is cost-effective and allows for more extensive investigations of the epileptogenic process than human studies, animal models have limitations because they do not recapitulate all aspects of the human disease. Careful evaluations and comparisons of data from both humans and animals are therefore essential. For example, if a specific pathology is present in humans with established epilepsy and the same pathology drives epileptogenesis in animals, then the finding would be high on the list of candidate antiepileptogenic targets for human use.","The cellular, molecular, and metabolic mechanisms that underlie the development of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy are incompletely understood. Here we review the role of astrocytes in epilepsy development (a.k.a. epileptogenesis), particularly astrocyte pathologies related to aquaporin 4, the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1, monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT2, excitatory amino acid transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2, and glutamine synthetase. We propose that inhibition, dysfunction or loss of astrocytic glutamine synthetase is an important causative factor for some epilepsies, particularly mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and glioblastoma-associated epilepsy. We postulate that the regulatory mechanisms of glutamine synthetase as well as the downstream effects of glutamine synthetase dysfunction, represent attractive, new targets for antiepileptogenic interventions. Currently, no antiepileptogenic therapies are available for human use. The discovery of such interventions is important as it will fundamentally change the way we approach epilepsy by preventing the disease from ever becoming manifest after an epileptogenic insult to the brain.",https//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jnr.24267?download=true

Notch inhibition via the gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 has emerged as a potential therapeutic option based on modulation of the cancer-initiating cell (CIS) population and a presumed antiangiogenic role.Experimental Design In this phase O/I trial, 21 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma or anaplastic as trocytoma received RO4929097 combined with temozolomide and radiotherapy. In addition to establishing the MTD, the study design enabled exploratory studies evaluating tumor and brain drug penetration and neuroimaging parameters. We also determined functional effects on the Notch pathway and targeting of CISs through analysis of tumor tissue sampled from areas with and without blood-brain barrier disruption. Finally, recurrent tumors were also sampled and assessed for Notch pathway responses while on treatment. Treatment was well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. 1FIC of treated tumors showed a significant decrease in proliferation and in the expression of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) by tumor cells and blood vessels. Patient-specific organotypic tumor explants cultures revealed a specific decrease in the CD133(+) CIS population upon treatment. Perfusion MRI demonstrated a significant decrease in relative plasma volume after drug exposure. Gene expression data in recurrent tumors suggested low Notch signaling activity, the upregulation of key mesenchymal genes, and an increase in VEGF-dependent angiogenic factors. The addition of RO4929097 to temozolomide and radiotherapy was well tolerated; the drug has a variable blood-brain barrier penetration.

8253,PIK3CB/p110 beta is a selective survival factor for glioblastoma,"resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, and consequently no standard-of-care treatment currently exists. Hence, it is imperative to find new and effective treatments for GBM. To identify novel therapeutic targets, we carried out an RNA interference screen in a previous study and identified 20 human kinase genes as important survival factors for UMG GBM cells.  Further examination using the clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) led to the identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for GBM recurrence. One candidate biomarker is phosphatidylinositol-,-biphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit β (PIK3CB), which encodes a catalytic subunit p1β of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) gene family. This family consists of kinases that transmit extracellular signals from growth factors, cytokines, and other environmental inputs into intracellular signals that regulate a multitude of signaling pathways.  In mammals, there are  classes of PI3K (classes IA, IB, II, and III). Class IA PI3K consists of 3 homologous isoforms-PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PIK3CD-that encode catalytic subunits p1α, p1β, and p1δ, respectively. These subunits bind to one p regulatory subunit (α, β, or γ) encoded by PIK3R1, PIK3R2, and PIK3R3 to form a heterodimer. Class IB PI3K has the fourth catalytic isoform, PIK3CG (encoding p1γ), which interacts with its regulator p1 encoded by PIK3R. This p1γ subunit is nearly exclusively expressed in immune cells.  Class IA PI3Ks bind to and convert membrane phosphatidylinositol-,-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol-3,,-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is a secondary messenger that activates V-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) to sustain cell survival.  Research in exploring the role of PI3K isoforms in GBM is still in its infancy. However, results from prior studies are often contradictory and inconsistent. For instance, depletion of PIK3CB, but not of PIK3CA, inhibited the growth of UMG cells  and sensitized these cells to apoptosis induced by an apoptosis-inducing ligand.  In U21 cells, PIK3CB/p1β knockdown impeded their growth in culture and in mice as a single agent,  or together with ectopically expressed phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).  In contrast, PIK3CA/p1α inhibition failed to block AKT activation in U21 and UMG cells and to synergize with PTEN to inhibit tumor cell growth. ,  These results suggest that p1β is more important than p1α in controlling GBM cell survival. However, Hu et al found that depleting PIK3CA also reduced the levels of phosphorylated (p)AKT in UMG cells.  Höland et al showed that PIK- (a p1α-selective inhibitor), but not TGX-221 (a p1β-selective inhibitor), inhibited the growth of TG cells, despite both inhibitors effectively blocking AKT activation.  In all studies described above, expression of PI3K isoforms was not examined in GBM cell lines harboring different genetic mutations in PI3K signaling (eg, PTEN). In addition, most of these studies lack further corroborating evidence in clinical tumor samples. Hence, the roles of PI3K isoforms in GBM still remain to be fully defined.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is difficult to treat. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is an attractive therapeutic target for GBM; however, targeting this pathway to effectively treat GBM is not successful because the roles of PI3K isoforms remain to be defined. The aim of this study is to determine whether PIK3CB/p110 beta, but not other PI3K isoforms, is a biomarker for GBM recurrence and important for cell survival.Gene expression and clinical relevance of PI3K genes in GBM patients were analyzed using online databases. Expression/activity of PI3K isoforms was determined using immunoblotting. PI3K genes were inhibited using short hairpin RNAs or isoform-selective inhibitors. Cell viability/growth was assessed by the MTS assay and trypan blue exclusion assay. Apoptosis was monitored using the caspase activity assay. Mouse GBM xenograft models were used to gauge drug efficacy.PIK3CB/p110 beta was the only PI3K catalytic isoform that significantly correlated with high incidence rate, risk, and poor survival of recurrent GBM. PIK3CA/p110 alpha, PIK3CB/p110 beta, and PIK3CD/p110 delta were differentially expressed in GBM cell lines and primary tumor cells derived from patient specimens, whereas PIK3CG/p110 gamma was barely detected. PIK3CB/p110 beta protein levels presented a stronger association with the activities of PI3K signaling than other PI3K isoforms. Blocking p110 beta deactivated PI3K signaling, whereas inhibition of other PI3K isoforms had no effect. Specific inhibitors of PIK3CB/p110 beta, but not other PI3K isoforms, remarkably suppressed viability and growth of GBM cells and xenograft tumors in mice, with minimal cytotoxic effects on astrocytes.PIK3CB/p110 beta is a biomarker for GBM recurrence and selectively important for GBM cell survival.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5909664/pdf/nox181.pdf
8280,Glioblastoma Treatments An Account of Recent Industrial Developments,"Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is a malignant tumor originating from glial cells. It is the most frequent brain tumor, representing 30% of all central nervous system tumors (CNST), 45% of malignant CNST and 80% of primary malignant CNST. It leads to 225,000 deaths per year in the entire word. It has an incidence of 5 per 100,000 persons, affects 1.5 times more men than women, and is diagnosed at an average age of 64  . Due to the relatively limited number of people suffering from GBM, it is difficult to determine with certainty the causes of this disease. The only well-established GBM risk factor is exposure to radiation. Radiofrequency electromagnetic fields such as those produced by mobile phones have been classified as IIB and may also play a role in GBM appearance  . By contrast to other types of cancers, it appears uncertain that GBM incidence can be decreased by changing certain environmental factors such as alcohol or tobacco consumption. Since the majority of GBM appear for the first time, i.e., only ∼40% originates from tumors of lower grades, it also seems rather uneasy to anticipate GBM from the presence of another disease or condition.","The different drugs and medical devices, which are commercialized or under industrial development for glioblastoma treatment, are reviewed. Their different modes of action are analyzed with a distinction being made between the effects of radiation, the targeting of specific parts of glioma cells, and immunotherapy. Most of them are still at a too early stage of development to firmly conclude about their efficacy. Optune, which triggers antitumor activity by blocking the mitosis of glioma cells under the application of an alternating electric field, seems to be the only recently developed therapy with some efficacy reported on a large number of GBM patients. The need for early GBM diagnosis is emphasized since it could enable the treatment of GBM tumors of small sizes, possibly easier to eradicate than larger tumors. Ways to improve clinical protocols by strengthening preclinical studies using of a broader range of different animal and tumor models are also underlined. Issues related with efficient drug delivery and crossing of blood brain barrier are discussed. Finally societal and economic aspects are described with a presentation of the orphan drug status that can accelerate the development of GBM therapies, patents protecting various GBM treatments, the different actors tackling GBM disease, the cost of GBM treatments, GBM market figures, and a financial analysis of the different companies involved in the development of GBM therapies.",https//fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/376931/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fphar-09-00879/fphar-09-00879.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=mk%2BdCqK8NUHuru07Mg9Otbq5f3QGzySvc9s7I%2BFBIf4%3D&se=2021-03-02T01%3A43%3A27Z&sp=r&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27fphar-09-00879.pdf
8481,Advanced interstitial chemotherapy combined with targeted treatment of malignant glioma in rats by using drug-loaded nanofibrous membranes,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been the most prevalent and malignant type of cancer in the central nervous system (CNS). GBM has a median survival rate of around 12-15 months when standard treatment is administered   . However, the median survival rate of patients with GBM has not significantly changed, despite more than two decades of researches on the development of various agents and delivery systems    . The tumour location is associated with the poor penetration of drugs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and also","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most prevalent and malignant form of a primary brain tumour, is resistant to chemotherapy. In this study, we concurrently loaded three chemotherapeutic agents [bis-chloroethylnitrosourea, irinotecan, and cisplatin; BIC] into 50 50 poly[(d,l)-lactide-co-glycolide] (PLGA) nanofibres and an antiangiogenic agent (combretastatin) into 75 25 PLGA nanofibres [BIC and combretastatin (BICC)/PLGA]. The BICC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes were surgically implanted onto the brain surfaces of healthy rats for conducting pharmacodynamic studies and onto C6 glioma-bearing rats for estimating the therapeutic efficacy.The chemotherapeutic agents were rapidly released from the 50 50 PLGA nanofibres after implantation, followed by the release of combretastatin (approximately 2 weeks later) from the 75 25 PLGA nanofibres. All drug concentrations remained higher in brain tissues than in the blood for more than 8 weeks. The experimental results, including attenuated malignancy, retarded tumour growth, and prolonged survival in tumour-bearing rats, demonstrated the efficacy of the BICC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes. Furthermore, the efficacy of BIC/PLGA and BICC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes was compared. The BICC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes more efficiently retarded the tumour growth and attenuated the malignancy of C6 glioma-bearing rats. Moreover, the addition of combretastatin did not significantly change the drug release behaviour of the BIC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes. The present advanced and novel interstitial chemotherapy and targeted treatment provide a potential strategy and regimen for treating GBM.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5312357/pdf/oncotarget-07-59902.pdf
8506,Inhibition of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) improves chemotherapy drug response in primary and recurrent glioblastoma multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive grade IV brain cancer with an extremely poor prognostic outcome despite intensive treatment regimes. GBM represent approximately 17% of all primary brain tumors diagnosed worldwide; and 60-75% of astrocytomas, increasing in frequency with age  . Prognosis is reported as ""median survival"" which, for adults with aggressive GBM treated according to the standard Stupp protocol  ) is 14.6 months. The average five year survival is less than 3%, leading to the fact that GBM is the most lethal form of brain tumor.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer with extremely poor prognostic outcome despite intensive treatment. All chemotherapeutic agents currently used have no greater than 30-40% response rate, many fall into the range of 10-20%, with delivery across the blood brain barrier (BBB) or chemoresistance contributing to the extremely poor outcomes despite treatment. Increased expression of the multidrug resistance protein 1(MRP1) in high grade glioma, and it's role in BBB active transport, highlights this member of the ABC transporter family as a target for improving drug responses in GBM. In this study we show that small molecule inhibitors and gene silencing of MRP1 had a significant effect on GBM cell response to temozolomide (150 mu M), vincristine (100 nM), and etoposide (2 mu M). Pre-treatment with Reversan (inhibitor of MRP1 and P-glycoprotein) led to a significantly improved response to cell death in the presence of all three chemotherapeutics, in both primary and recurrent GBM cells. The presence of MK571 (inhibitor of MRP1 and multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) led to an enhanced effect of vincristine and etoposide in reducing cell viability over a 72 h period. Specific MRP1 inhibition led to a significant increase in vincristine and etoposide-induced cell death in all three cell lines assessed. Treatment with MK571, or specific MRP1 knockdown, did not have any effect on temozolomide drug response in these cells. These findings have significant implications in providing researchers an opportunity to improve currently used chemotherapeutics for the initial treatment of primary GBM, and improved treatment for recurrent GBM patients.",https//fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/147521/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fnins-09-00218/fnins-09-00218.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=Q8dZIC48M3my1bHgQF3LYLYOLMPpEiC3HseqEmPvfnQ%3D&se=2021-03-02T02%3A36%3A25Z&sp=r&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27fnins-09-00218.pdf
8528,Feasibility study of using high-throughput drug sensitivity testing to target recurrent glioblastoma stem cells for individualized treatment,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating form of cancer. Despite multidisciplinary treatment, the tumor almost invariably recurs within 9 months   . For the recurrent disease, there are no treatment options documented to prolong survival, possibly leaving enrollment into a clinical trial the best treatment option  ."," Despite the well described heterogeneity in glioblastoma (GBM), treatment is standardized, and clinical trials investigate treatment effects at population level. Genomics-driven oncology for stratified treatments allow clinical decision making in only a small minority of screened patients. Addressing tumor heterogeneity, we aimed to establish a clinical translational protocol in recurrent GBM (recGBM) utilizing autologous glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) cultures and automated high-throughput drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) for individualized treatment within the time available for clinical application.  From ten patients undergoing surgery for recGBM, we established individual cell cultures and characterized the GSCs by functional assays. 7/10 GSC cultures could be serially expanded. The individual GSCs displayed intertumoral differences in their proliferative capacity, expression of stem cell markers and variation in their in vitro and in vivo morphology. We defined a time frame of 10 weeks from surgery to complete the entire pre-clinical work-up; establish individualized GSC cultures, evaluate drug sensitivity patterns of 525 anticancer drugs, and identify options for individualized treatment. Within the time frame for clinical translation 5/7 cultures reached sufficient cell yield for complete drug screening. The DSRT revealed significant intertumoral heterogeneity to anticancer drugs (p < 0.0001). Using curated reference databases of drug sensitivity in GBM and healthy bone marrow cells, we identified individualized treatment options in all patients. Individualized treatment options could be selected from FDA-approved drugs from a variety of different drug classes in all cases.  In recGBM, GSC cultures could successfully be established in the majority of patients. The individual cultures displayed intertumoral heterogeneity in their in vitro and in vivo behavior. Within a time frame for clinical application, we could perform DSRT in 50% of recGBM patients. The DSRT revealed a remarkable intertumoral heterogeneity in sensitivity to anticancer drugs in recGBM that could allow tailored therapeutic options for functional precision medicine.",https//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1186/s40169-019-0253-6?download=true
8565,Overcoming the Blood-Brain Barrier Successes and Challenges in Developing Nanoparticle-Mediated Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Brain Tumours,"isocitrate dehydrogenase, deletion of p/9q chromosome, and histone mutations.  However, malignant or high grade (III and IV) gliomas are characterized by very poor prognosis. Furthermore, 8-0% of the adult patients with cancer develop brain metastases, with considerably variable incidence among different primary cancers. Lung, breast, colon, kidney cancer or melanoma can lead to brain metastases, 70% of which originating from lung and breast cancer.  ","High-grade gliomas are still characterized by a poor prognosis, despite recent advances in surgical treatment. Chemotherapy is currently practiced after surgery, but its efficacy is limited by aspecific toxicity on healthy cells, tumour cell chemoresistance, poor selectivity, and especially by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus, despite the large number of potential drug candidates, the choice of effective chemotherapeutics is still limited to few compounds. Malignant gliomas are characterized by high infiltration and neovascularization, and leaky BBB (the so-called blood-brain tumour barrier); surgical resection is often incomplete, leaving residual cells that are able to migrate and proliferate. Nanocarriers can favour delivery of chemotherapeutics to brain tumours owing to different strategies, including chemical stabilization of the drug in the bloodstream; passive targeting (because of the leaky vascularization at the tumour site); inhibition of drug efflux mechanisms in endothelial and cancer cells; and active targeting by exploiting carriers and receptors overexpressed at the blood-brain tumour barrier. Within this concern, a suitable nanomedicine-based therapy for gliomas should not be limited to cytotoxic agents, but also target the most important pathogenetic mechanisms, including cell differentiation pathways and angiogenesis. Moreover, the combinatorial approach of cell therapy plus nanomedicine strategies can open new therapeutical opportunities. The major part of attempted preclinical approaches on animal models involves active targeting with protein ligands, but, despite encouraging results, a few number of nanomedicines reached clinical trials, and most of them include drug-loaded nanocarriers free of targeting ligands, also because of safety and scalability concerns.",https//www.dovepress.com/front_end/cr_data/cache/pdf/download_1614649781_603d99b545f37/ijn-231479-overcoming-the-blood-brain-barrier-successes-and-challeng.pdf
8618,Convection-enhanced delivery for the treatment of brain tumors,"Accessibility of pharmacological agents from the bloodstream to the CNS meets with a formidable obstacle in the form of the BBB  . There is an absence of direct intracranial administration-only agents that are actively transported through the BBB or that are otherwise permeable through the barrier, which can directly kill tumor cells. Even for drugs that are permeable through the BBB it is difficult to obtain effective pharmacological concentrations through simple diffusion from blood to CNS  . Moreover, most drugs having an effect on the CNS are inherently not sufficiently permeable for the BBB. Another difficulty of delivering drugs to the CNS is how to direct them preferably to the discrete anatomic regions or diseased parts of brain. Another related question is how to maintain relatively constant and pharmacologically effective concentrations of the drugs in the diseased brain. These questions are particularly relevant to the delivery of antineoplastic drugs    .","The brain is highly accessible for nutrients and oxygen, however delivery of drugs to malignant brain tumors is a very challenging task. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) has been designed to overcome some of the difficulties so that pharmacological agents that would not normally cross the BBB can be used for treatment. Drugs are delivered through one to several catheters placed stereotactically directly within the tumor mass or around the tumor or the resection cavity. Several classes of drugs are amenable to this technology including standard chemotherapeutics or novel experimental targeted drugs. The first Phase III trial for CED-delivered, molecularly targeted cytotoxin in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme has been accomplished and demonstrated objective clinical efficacy. The lessons learned from more than a decade of attempts at exploiting CED for brain cancer treatment weigh critically for its future clinical applications. The main issues center around the type of catheters used, number of catheters and their exact placement; pharmacological formulation of drugs, prescreening patients undergoing treatment and monitoring the distribution of drugs in tumors and the tumor-infiltrated brain. It is expected that optimizing CED will make this technology a permanent addition to clinical management of brain malignancies.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3657605/pdf/nihms-155089.pdf
8643,Targeted Therapy with Anlotinib for a Patient with an OncogenicFGFR3-TACC3Fusion and Recurrent Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and fatal primary brain tumor. Despite aggressive treatment, the median overall survival (OS) is less than 15 months  . The preferred treatment for GBM is surgery, and subsequent treatment is a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. For patients with recurrent GBM, targeted therapies are limited    . Molecular markers of GBM are needed to improve personalized diagnosis and treatment and to better understand the biology of the disease to facilitate the development of new therapies  .","We describe a case of recurrent glioblastoma treated with anlotinib in this report. The patient was administered anlotinib 12 mg p.o. once every day (days 1-14, with a 21-day cycle) (anlotinib clinical study NCT04004975) and oral temozolomide chemotherapy 100 mg/m(2)(days 1-7, days 15-21, 28-day cycle; 12 cycles). After 2 months of therapy, the patient achieved a partial response that has been maintained for >17 months of follow-up. Molecular characterization confirmed the presence of aTERTpromoter mutation, wild-typeIDH1/2, anFGFR3-TACC3fusion, andFGFR3amplification in the patient. Anlotinib is a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor that was originally designed to inhibit VEGFR2/3, FGFR1-4, PDGFR alpha/beta, and c-Kit. Patients withTERTpromoter mutations and high-gradeIDH-wild-type glioma have shorter overall survival than patients withIDH-wild-type glioma withoutTERTpromoter mutations. However, this patient had a favorable clinic outcome, andFGFR3-TACC3fusion may be a new marker for treatment of glioma with anlotinib. Key PointsThis case study is believed to be the first report thatFGFR3-TACC3fusion could be a novel indication to treat recurrent glioblastoma with the drug anlotinib. This case exhibited an exceptional response (maintained partial response >17 months) after 2-month combined therapy of anlotinib and oral temozolomide chemotherapy. This case also underscores the importance of molecular diagnosis for clinically complex cases.

8656,Continuous daily sunitinib for recurrent glioblastoma,"Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) face a poor prognosis. Standard upfront therapy with chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy prolongs median overall survival to only 15 months  . Targeted treatment with the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (BEV) in the setting of progressive disease produces a radiographic response in a high percentage of patients but with only modest progression-free survival benefit  . Tumors that progress through treatment with BEV are highly resistant to standard salvage therapies and may exhibit a more invasive phenotype  . Resistance to anti-VEGF therapy remains an area of investigation, but targeting multiple growth-associated signaling pathways may result in more effective treatment than targeting VEGF alone  .","Bevacizumab ((BEV) has become a mainstay of treating recurrent glioblastoma, but eventual tumor resistance is expected. Targeting multiple growth-associated signaling pathways may result in more effective treatment than targeting VEGF alone. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma were stratified by prior BEV exposure and treated with sunitinib 37.5 mg daily in this phase II study. Response evaluations were performed at baseline and at the end of every 4 week cycle. Six-month progression-free survival (PFS6) was the primary endpoint for both arms of the study. Secondary endpoints included health related quality of life measures and FDG-PET correlatives with patient outcomes. Sixty-three patients were accrued to this study; thirty-two were BEV-na < ve, 31 were BEV-resistant. PFS6 was 10.4 % [95 % CI 3.2-33.8] in the BEV-na < ve cohort and 0 % in the BEV-resistant cohort. Median overall survival was 9.4 months [95 % CI 6.15-21.90] in the BEV-na < ve cohort and 4.37 months [95 % CI 3.02-6.21] in the BEV-resistant cohort. 3/29 patients (10 %) of the BEV-na < ve, and 0/27 BEV-resistant patients achieved radiographic response. Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and neutropenia were the most common drug-associated adverse events and occurred with higher frequency than expected. Sunitinib treatment in BEV-na < ve patients did not appear to affect outcomes with subsequent BEV therapy.

Recently, advances in the understanding of angiogenesis pathways    as well as Quintino Giorgio D'Alessandris and Nicola Montano contributed equally to the work. Roche Spa provided bevacizumab for two patients in the present study. Roche Spa had no role in design and conduct of the study, collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data, nor preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript.","Advances in comprehension of molecular biology of glioblastoma (GBM) have led to the development of targeted therapies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a targeted therapeutic approach in which administration of bevacizumab and erlotinib was tailored on the molecular profile of recurrent GBM.We prospectively enrolled ten adult patients suffering from recurrent GBM who had undergone surgical resection and standard chemo-radiotherapy. Tumor tissue was assessed for the expression of EGFRvIII and MGMT promoter methylation by RT-PCR, and for PTEN and VEGF expression by immunohistochemistry. Normal PTEN status was required for inclusion. Patients with VEGF overexpressing tumors (10/10) were treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg iv every 2 weeks in 6-week cycles); patients whose tumor expressed EGFRvIII (4/10) added erlotinib (150 mg/day orally; 300 mg/day if on enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs). Therapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints of the study were response rate (RR), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6), and safety profile.The RR and PFS-6 were 100 % (4/4) and 50 % (3/6) in patients treated with bevacizumab+erlotinib (n = 4) and bevacizumab (n = 6), respectively. In the whole cohort (n = 10), RR and PFS-6 were both 70 % (7/10); median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 8.0 (3.0-31.0) and 9.5 (5.0-31.0) months, respectively. No grade 3/4 adverse events were observed; three patients treated with bevacizumab+erlotinib displayed grade 1/2 rash not requiring dose reduction; one patient treated with bevacizumab developed intratumoral hemorrhage requiring treatment discontinuation.To our knowledge, this is the first study on recurrent GBM in which administration of bevacizumab and erlotinib was tailored on the molecular profile of the patient's tumor.

Bevacizumab, an angiogenesis inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma  . Even with the addition of bevacizumab treatment, survival is not significantly improved  and recently, bevacizumab has been shown to have almost no effect on overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma   .","Glioblastoma remains the most common, malignant primary cancer of the central nervous system with a low life expectancy and an overall survival of less than 1.5 years. The treatment options are limited and there is no cure. Moreover, almost all patients develop recurrent tumors, which typically are more aggressive. Therapeutically resistant glioblastoma or glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are hypothesized to cause this inevitable recurrence. Identifying prognostic biomarkers of glioblastoma will potentially advance knowledge about glioblastoma tumorigenesis and enable discovery of more effective therapies. Proteomic analysis of more than 600 glioblastoma-specific proteins revealed, for the first time, that expression of acid ceramidase (ASAH1) is associated with poor glioblastoma survival. CD133+ GSCs express significantly higher ASAH1 compared to CD133-GSCs and serum-cultured glioblastoma cell lines, such as U87MG. These findings implicate ASAH1 as a plausible independent prognostic marker, providing a target for a therapy tailored toward GSCs. We further demonstrate that ASAH1 inhibition increases cellular ceramide level and induces apoptosis. Strikingly, U87MG cells, and three different patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cancer cell lines were efficiently killed, through apoptosis, by three different known ASAH1 inhibitors with IC50's ranging from 11-104 mu M. In comparison, the standard glioblastoma chemotherapy agent, temozolomide, had minimal GSC-targeted effects at comparable or even higher concentrations (IC50 > 750 mu M against GSCs). ASAH1 is identified as a de novo glioblastoma drug target, and ASAH1 inhibitors, such as carmofur, are shown to be highly effective and to specifically target glioblastoma GSCs. Carmofur is an ASAH1 inhibitor that crosses the blood-brain barrier, a major bottleneck in glioblastoma treatment. It has been approved in Japan since 1981 for colorectal cancer therapy. Therefore, it is poised for repurposing and translation to glioblastoma clinical trials.",https//www.oncotarget.com/article/22637/pdf/

In vitro antitumor effects were examined in three matching pairs of monolayer and neurosphere lines established from patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of the untreated (IC-4687GBM), recurrent (IC-3752GBM), and terminal (IC-R0315GBM) tumors, and in vivo therapeutic efficacy through log rank analysis of survival times in two models (IC-4687GBMand IC-R0315GBM) followingMLN8237 treatment (30 mg/kg/day, orally, 12 days). Drug concentrations in vivo and mechanism of action and resistance were also investigated. AURKA mRNA overexpression was detected in 14 pGBM tumors, 10 PDOX models, and 6 cultured pGBM lines as compared with 11 low-grade gliomas and normal brains. MLN8237 penetrated into pGBM xenografts in mouse brains. Significant extension of survival times were achieved in IC-4687GBM of which both neurosphere and monolayer were inhibited in vitro, but not in IC-R0315GBM of which only neurosphere cells responded (similar to IC-3752GBM). Apoptosis-mediated MLN8237 induced cell death, and the presence of AURKA-negative and CD133(+) cells appears to have contributed to in vivo therapy resistance. MLN8237 successfully targeted AURKA in a subset of pGBMs. Our data suggest that combination therapy should aim at AURKA-negative and/or CD133(+) pGBM cells to prevent tumor recurrence.

Although initial clinical results in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) were disappointing, recently published results have demonstrated a potential survival benefit in patients with recurrent GBM treated with neoadjuvant programmed cell death protein 1 blockade. While these findings necessitate verification in subsequent studies, they support the possibility of achieving clinical meaningful immune responses in malignant primary brain tumors including GBM, a disease in dire need of additional therapeutic options. There are several challenges involved in treating glioma with immune checkpoint modulators including the immunosuppressive nature of GBM itself with high inhibitory checkpoint expression, the immunoselective blood brain barrier impairing the ability for peripheral lymphocytes to traffic to the tumor microenvironment and the high prevalence of corticosteroid use which suppress lymphocyte activation.

This review summarizes our current understanding of T lymphocyte-modulating checkpoint molecules as it pertains to glioma with the hope for a renewed focus on the most promising therapeutic strategies.",https//jitc.bmj.com/content/jitc/8/1/e000379.full.pdf
8798,The autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid-lysophosphatidic acid receptor cascade proposal of a novel potential therapeutic target for treating glioblastoma multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most highly malignant type of brain tumor. Despite the use of optimal treatments and an evolving standard of care (maximal safe resection with concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and radiation therapy), the median survival of patients diagnosed with GBM is only 12 to 16 months  . GBM cells are highly motile and invade the normal brain parenchyma diffusely, resulting in poor prognosis  . Because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted in GBM, some components in plasma or serum may be able to affect the cell motility of GBM  . The most plausible components are considered to be autotaxin (ATX) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). ATX is a potent cell motility-stimulating factor that is identical to lysophospholipase D and that produces a bioactive phospholipid, LPA, from lysophosphatidyl choline. ATX is overexpressed in GBM. In addition, LPA , the LPA receptor (LPAR) responsible for LPA-driven cell motility, is predominantly expressed in GBM  . These important results suggest that the ATX/LPAR axis may be a target for GBM therapy. Here, the author reviews current results, focusing on the promising information on the ATX/LPA/LPAR cascade that may lead to amelioration of GBM.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Its prognosis is one of the worst among all cancer types, and it is considered a fatal malignancy, incurable with conventional therapeutic strategies. As the bioactive multifunctional lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is well recognized to be involved in the tumorigenesis of cancers by acting on G-protein-coupled receptors, LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonists and LPA synthesis inhibitors have been proposed as promising drugs for cancer treatment. Six LPARs, named LPA(1-6), are currently recognized. Among them, LPA(1) is the dominant LPAR in the CNS and is highly expressed in GBM in combination with the overexpression of autotaxin (ATX), the enzyme (a phosphodiesterase, which is a potent cell motility-stimulating factor) that produces LPA.Invasion is a defining hallmark of GBM. LPA is significantly related to cell adhesion, cell motility, and invasion through the Rho family GTPases Rho and Rac. LPA(1) is responsible for LPA-driven cell motility, which is attenuated by LPA(4). GBM is among the most vascular human tumors. Although anti-angiogenic therapy (through the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) was established, sufficient results have not been obtained because of the increased invasiveness triggered by anti-angiogenesis. As both ATX and LPA play a significant role in angiogenesis, similar to VEGF, inhibition of the ATX/LPA axis may be beneficial as a two-pronged therapy that includes anti-angiogenic and anti-invasion therapy. Conventional approaches to GBM are predominantly directed at cell proliferation. Recurrent tumors regrow from cells that have invaded brain tissues and are less proliferative, and are thus quite resistant to conventional drugs and radiation, which preferentially kill rapidly proliferating cells. A novel approach that targets this invasive subpopulation of GBM cells may improve the prognosis of GBM. Patients with GBM that contacts the subventricular zone (SVZ) have decreased survival. A putative source of GBM cells is the SVZ, the largest area of neurogenesis in the adult human brain. GBM stem cells in the SVZ that are positive for the neural stem cell surface antigen CD133 are highly tumorigenic and enriched in recurrent GBM. LPA(1) expression appears to be increased in these cells. Here, the author reviews research on the ATX/LPAR axis, focusing on GBM and an ATX/LPAR-targeted approach.",https//lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12944-015-0059-5.pdf
8829,Immunogene therapy of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme with a liposomally encapsulated replication-incompetent Semliki forest virus vector carrying the human interleukin-12 gene - a phase I/II clinical protocol,"Malignant glioma is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in adults under 35 years of age, and the fourth leading cause in those under 54 years. Median survival time in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common type of malignant glioma, ranges between 40 and 50 weeks, with most patients surviving less than 2 years    . Despite aggressive multimodal therapy which includes surgical debulking of tumor, post-operative radiation and/or chemotherapy, prognosis in GBM patients still remains poor. Median survival time after GBM recurrence is only 3-6 months depending on age and Karnofsky performance score   . The main challenges in treating GBM are local recurrences after initial response to treatment, or progressive tumor growth and resistance to adjuvant therapy.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor resistant to standard treatment modalities such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Since recurrent GBM tends to develop predominantly within the infiltrative rim surrounding the primary tumor focus, novel therapy strategies need in addition to focal tumor destruction to target this somewhat diffuse area.This is a phase I/II clinical study in adult patients with recurrent GBM which is aimed at evaluating biological safety, maximum tolerated dose, and antitumor efficacy of a genetically modified replication-disabled Semliki forest virus vector (SFV) carrying the human interleukin 12 (IL-12) gene and encapsulated in cationic liposomes (LSFV-IL12). The vector will be administered in doses of 1 x 10(7)-1 x 10(9) infectious particles by continuous intratumoral infusion, thus exploiting the advantages of convection-enhanced drug delivery in the brain. The present protocol is also designed to investigate systemic and local immune response and to identify factors predicting tumor response to LSFV-IL12 therapy, such as volume of extracellular space of the tumor, volume of contrast enhancing lesion, and immune status of the patients.SFV, an insect alphavirus, infects mitotic and non-mitotic cells and triggers apoptosis in tumor cells within 48-72 h. Preclinical work with the LSFV-IL12 vector in breast and prostate cancer animal models demonstrated its biosafety and some antitumor efficacy. An ongoing phase I clinical study in patients with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma seems also to confirm the biosafety of intravenously administered vectors. This protocol will be the first study of SFV-IL12 therapy of human recurrent GBM.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02700029.pdf
8857,How to analyse the spatiotemporal tumour samples needed to investigate cancer evolution A case study using paired primary and recurrent glioblastoma,"Analysing multiple tumours from the same patient provides novel insights into cancer evolution.    Genomic subclones shared across spatiotemporal samples highlight candidate drivers of progressive behaviours, such as metastasis (spatially separated samples) and recurrence (temporally separated samples).   Using high-coverage DNA sequencing to characterise somatic mutations in all samples is the first step to identifying shared subclones. Best practices for somatic mutation calling in sequencing data were developed for application to single tumour samples and aim to reduce false positive calls caused by the relatively high error rates in highthroughput sequencers.    However when analysing multiple tumours, the most biologically relevant mutations are arguably those present in small subclones in one sample but expanded in others. Analysis must, therefore, maximise the chance of capturing such situations, ensuring shared lowallelic fraction mutations are not filtered out from the sample where they are less prevalent. This is especially important for formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples because this process is known to introduce artefacts at low-allelic fractions, and where multiple samples exist from the same patient it is likely that at least some will be in FFPE.   In considering this problem, we reasoned that multiple samples from the same patient provide internal and mutual validation for mutations that may have otherwise been more difficult to assign correctly. We therefore propose a new approach to somatic mutation calling across multiple matched samples  . A first round of low-stringency mutation calling to identify tumour-specific variants that self-validate i.e. are present in more than one dataset irrespective of the strength of evidence of any one call. We denote these Somatic TPs (true positives). 2. A second round of stringent mutation calling to additionally identify variants found only in one sample. We denote these Somatic Unknowns.","Many traits of cancer progression (e.g., development of metastases or resistance to therapy) are facilitated by tumour evolution Darwinian selection of subclones with distinct genotypes or phenotypes that enable such progression. Characterising these subclones provide an opportunity to develop drugs to better target their specific properties but requires the accurate identification of somatic mutations shared across multiple spatiotemporal tumours from the same patient. Current best practices for calling somatic mutations are optimised for single samples, and risk being too conservative to identify shared mutations with low prevalence in some samples. We reasoned that datasets from multiple matched tumours can be used for mutual validation and thus propose an adapted two-stage approach (1) low-stringency mutation calling to identify mutations shared across samples irrespective of the weight of evidence in a single sample; (2) high-stringency mutation calling to further characterise mutations present in a single sample. We applied our approach to three-independent cohorts of paired primary and recurrent glioblastoma tumours, two of which have previously been analysed using existing approaches, and found that it significantly increased the amount of biologically relevant shared somatic mutations identified. We also found that duplicate removal was detrimental when identifying shared somatic mutations. Our approach is also applicable when multiple datasets e.g. DNA and RNA are available for the same tumour.",https//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ijc.31184?download=true
8877,Hsp90 inhibition enhances PI-3 kinase inhibition and radiosensitivity in glioblastoma,"glioblastoma (gBM) is the most common and lethal primary malignant glioma in adults. The standard of care for newly diagnosed gBM is maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy with the alkylating agent, temozolomide (TMZ). Despite optimal treatment, almost all tumors recur a median of 7 months after treatment  , producing a median survival of only 14.6 months   . Two major factors explaining gBM's aggressive phenotype are as follows (1) heterogenic subpopulations within the tumor and (2) the existence of overlapping and redundant cellular signaling pathways driving tumor progression. Hence, it is not surprising that the addition of single-targeted agents has failed to improve outcomes; a multi-targeted approach may, however, be more successful. In pursuit of this approach, we studied the results of targeting the phosphatidylinositol-3′kinase (PI3 K)/akt pathway in conjunction with heat shock (Hsp) 90 inhibition especially since earlier studies showed that dual blockade of Hsp90 and PI3 K/akt/mTOR pathways had beneficial effects in a variety of tumor models    ."," Combined targeting with a PI3-kinase inhibitor, BKM120, and an Hsp90 inhibitor, HSP990, was investigated as a multi-targeted approach to potentiate cell death in glioblastoma (GBM). Additionally, the effect of dual drug treatment combined with cytotoxic stress (radiation therapy) was examined.s Four human GBM cell lines containing wildtype or mutated PTEN and/or p53 were studied. The effects of drug treatments on cell viability, apoptosis induction, pAKt activity, cell cycle arrest, clonogenicity, and tumor growth delay were studied. Combined concurrent treatment with both drugs produced more cell killing in cell viability and apoptosis assays than either drug alone. BKM120 plus HSP990 induced suppression of baseline Akt signaling as well as radiation (RT)-induced pAkt signaling in all cell lines. Cell cycle analysis revealed that HSP990 and BKM120, singly or combined, induced G2/M arrest leading to apoptosis/necrosis and polyploidy. Additionally, the drugs radiosensitized GBM cells in clonogenic assays. In vivo tumor growth delay studies demonstrated the effectiveness of combined drug treatment with HSP990 and BKM120 over single drug treatment, as well as the effectiveness of combined drug treatment in enhancing the effectiveness of radiation therapy. In conclusion, HSP990 and BKM120, with and without RT, are active agents against glioma tumors. The sensitivity to these agents does not appear to depend on PTEN/p53status in the cell lines tested. We suggest that the combined action of both drugs is a viable multi-targeted strategy with the potential to improve clinical outcome for patients with high-grade glioma.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00432-014-1594-6.pdf
8903,Drug Delivery Nanosystems for the Localized Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Glioblastoma or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant form of glioma, which is the tumor associated with neoplastic glial cells in the brain, including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and ependymal cells  . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), GBM is classified as a grade IV brain tumor, which is the most aggressive variation of the malignancies of the central nervous system (CNS)  . GBM is also one of the most prevalent malignant brain tumors, with an incidence rate of about 3.19 per 100,000 people per annum  . The etiology of GBM remains unknown, although one of the identified risk factors is the abnormal exposure to ionizing radiation  . This disease has a complex genetic expression, including gains of chromosomes 7 and 19, losses of chromosomes 10 and 13, amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MDM2, mutation of PTEN, NF1, PDGFRA1, IDH1/2, and deletion of CDKN2A/B  . Moreover, the histological characteristics of GBM are quite as diverse as its genetic expression, including increasing mitotic and cellular activity, significant angiogenesis, and necrosis. The shape and size of tumor cells are also highly variable, thus the term multiforme  . GBM invades within the CNS and rarely metastasizes to distant regions  . The common symptoms associated with GBM are headaches, cognitive impairment and personality changes, gait imbalances, incontinence, sensory loss, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, and delirium. Most of the symptoms are nonspecific, therefore, the disease has the risk to be misdiagnosed as other neurological or psychological disorders, such as dementia, epilepsy, or stroke  .","Glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most prevalent and malignant forms of central nervous system tumors. The treatment of glioblastoma remains a great challenge due to its location in the intracranial space and the presence of the blood-brain tumor barrier. There is an urgent need to develop novel therapy approaches for this tumor, to improve the clinical outcomes, and to reduce the rate of recurrence and adverse effects associated with present options. The formulation of therapeutic agents in nanostructures is one of the most promising approaches to treat glioblastoma due to the increased availability at the target site, and the possibility to co-deliver a range of drugs and diagnostic agents. Moreover, the local administration of nanostructures presents significant additional advantages, since it overcomes blood-brain barrier penetration issues to reach higher concentrations of therapeutic agents in the tumor area with minimal side effects. In this paper, we aim to review the attempts to develop nanostructures as local drug delivery systems able to deliver multiple agents for both therapeutic and diagnostic functions for the management of glioblastoma.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/materials/materials-11-00779/article_deploy/materials-11-00779-v3.pdf
8953,Safety and effectiveness of bevacizumab in Japanese patients with malignant glioma a post-marketing surveillance study,"Malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma, are the most common subtypes of primary brain tumours. These aggressive, highly invasive and neurologically destructive tumours  have an incidence of 5-20 cases per 1 00 000 population in Japan  and the United States  . The standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed GBM is safe, maximal surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide and maintenance temozolomide  . Tumour-treating field therapy has recently been introduced as an effective antimitotic treatment with minimal toxicity in patients with newly diagnosed GBM  . However, most of the patients experience tumour progression with a median survival of <15 months from the initial diagnosis (6-, a 1-year survival rate of 61-65%   ) and a 5-year survival rate of 16% () . Furthermore, there is no standard therapy for recurrent GBM, and the estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate is 11-16%   ."," This surveillance study was conducted to verify the post-market safety and effectiveness of bevacizumab, which was approved in Japan in 2013 for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and or recurrent malignant glioma.s This was a prospective, observational, multicenter post-marketing surveillance study. Patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma scheduled for bevacizumab treatment were enrolled. The incidence and severity of adverse drug reactions were calculated. The effectiveness of bevacizumab was assessed by the 1-year survival rate and the overall survival rate. The safety analysis set and the effectiveness analysis set each comprised 258 of the 268 enrolled patients tumours were newly diagnosed in 80 patients (31%) and recurrent in 178 patients (68.9%). The incidence of grade >= 3 adverse drug reactions was 15.1%. Adverse drug reactions of special interest included 14 cerebral bleeding events and 11 infections. Of the 80 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma, 44 (55%) were alive throughout the 18-month observation period. The 1-year survival rate for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma was 78%. Median overall survival was not calculated, but 51.2% of patients were alive at the last date of observation of the last observed patient. In patients with recurrent glioblastoma, the 1-year survival rate was 38.9%, and the median overall survival was 10.2 months. The results suggest no new safety concerns, and the effectiveness might be similar to previously reported data in clinical trials.

8975,Histone deacetylase inhibitors in glioblastoma pre-clinical and clinical experience,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most malignant primary brain cancer in adults. Despite optimal multimodality treatment consisting of surgical debulking, radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy, the median survival is 12-15 months. Over the last few years, there have been important advances made in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of glioblastoma. However, since the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) clinical trial in 2005, which showed survival benefit from adding temozolomide to surgery and radiotherapy in treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma  , all new therapeutic strategies have failed to prolong survival.","Epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly recognized as a major factor contributing to pathogenesis of cancer including glioblastoma, the most common and most malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Enzymatic modifications of histone proteins regulating gene expression are being exploited for therapeutic drug targeting. Over the last decade, numerous studies have shown promising results with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in various malignancies. This article provides a brief overview of mechanism of anti-cancer effect and pharmacology of HDAC inhibitors and summarizes results from pre-clinical and clinical studies in glioblastoma. It analyses experience with HDAC inhibitors as single agents as well as in combination with targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hallmark features of glioblastoma, such as uncontrolled cellular proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis, have been shown to be targeted by HDAC inhibitors in experiments with glioblastoma cell lines. Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor that entered clinical trials in glioblastoma, showing activity in recurrent disease. Multiple phase II trials with vorinostat in combination with targeted agents, temozolomide and radiotherapy are currently recruiting. While the results from pre-clinical studies are encouraging, early clinical trials showed only modest benefit and the value of HDAC inhibitors for clinical practice will need to be confirmed in larger prospective trials. Further research in epigenetic mechanisms driving glioblastoma pathogenesis and identification of molecular subtypes of glioblastoma is needed. This will hopefully lead to better selection of patients who will benefit from treatment with HDAC inhibitors.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12032-014-0985-5.pdf
9017,A phase I/II trial of enzastaurin in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas,"alignant gliomas are a major cause of cancerrelated morbidity and mortality in the United States. Even with aggressive surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the median survival of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) is less than 5 months.  Despite years of clinical research and numerous trials, there are very few drugs with significant activity against malignant gliomas. This experience has led many to believe that new therapeutic strategies against novel molecular targets are needed.","Enzastaurin, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C-beta, inhibits angiogenesis and has direct cytotoxic activity against glioma cells in preclinical studies. Patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas were stratified by histology and use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs). Patients on EIAED were treated on the phase I dose-escalation portion of the trial with evaluation of serum pharmacokinetics as the primary endpoint. Patients not on EIAED were treated on the phase 11 portion of the trial with radiographic response and progression-free survival (PFS) as primary objectives. Patients in phase I received enzastaurin 525-900 mg/d. Phase H patients received 500 or 525 mg1d. One hundred and eighteen patients were accrued to this trial. Therapy was well tolerated with thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, and elevated alanine aminotransferase as the most commonly observed drug-associated grade 3 or higher toxicities. Patients on EIAED had serum enzastaurin exposure levels approximately 80% lower than those not on EIAED. Dose escalations up to 900 mg/d did not substantially increase serum exposure levels and a maximally tolerated dose was never reached. Twenty-one of 84 evaluable patients (25%) experienced an objective radiographic response. The 6-month PFS was 7% for patients with glioblastoma and 16% for patients with anaplastic glioma. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was identified as a potential biomarker of drug activity. Enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2940576/pdf/nop042.pdf
9046,Viral Vectors as Gene Therapy Agents for Treatment of Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant primary brain cancer of predominantly astrocytic origin  . The main features of GBM that lead to malignancy and high mortality are its high resistance to DNA-damaging drugs, including the only Food and Drug Administration FDA-approved alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), which is achieved by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase overexpression, moderate response to radiation, genomic instability and powerful clonal selection. A particularly grave feature of GBM is its high invasiveness.","Glioblastoma is the most malignant cancer of the brain and current therapeutic strategies are clearly inadequate. In addition to surgical intervention, conventional drugs and ratio-therapy, scientists are looking at approaches based on gene therapy with genetically modified viruses. In this review we give a snapshot of the current state of play in this field of research and the available information about the clinical trials. We make some suggestions as to what opportunities could be explored further and hope that this review will stimulate discussion and conception of new life saving strategies.In this review, we scrutinize the idea of using viral vectors either as cytotoxic agents or gene delivery tools for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in light of the experience that our laboratory has accumulated over similar to 20 years when using similar vectors in experimental neuroscience. We review molecular strategies and current clinical trials and argue that approaches which are based on targeting a specific biochemical pathway or a characteristic mutation are inherently prone to failure because of the high genomic instability and clonal selection characteristics of GBM. For the same reasons, attempts to develop a viral system which selectively transduces only GBM cells are also unlikely to be universally successful. One of the common gene therapy approaches is to use cytotoxic viruses which replicate and cause preferential lysis of the GBM cells. This strategy, in addition to its reliance on the specific biochemical makeup of the GBM cells, bears a risk of necrotic cell death accompanied by release of large quantities of pro-inflammatory molecules. On the other hand, engaging the immune system in the anti-GBM response seems to be a potential avenue to explore further. We suggest that a plausible strategy is to focus on viral vectors which efficiently transduce brain cells via a non-selective, ubiquitous mechanism and which target (ideally irreversibly) processes that are critical only for dividing tumor cells and are dispensable for quiescent brain cells.",https//res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/cancers/cancers-12-03724/article_deploy/cancers-12-03724.pdf
9107,Anti-Angiogenics Their Role in the Treatment of Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is a disease that remains difficult to treat, with inevitable recurrence after standard therapy, which includes surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy   . For the lat-Despite these conceptual biological hurdles and complexities, there are arguments that speak for the use of anti-angiogenics in glioblastoma The angiogenic and space-occupying core tumor mass often causes the most severe symptoms in patients, by regional disturbances of the brain function with neurological symptoms, increased intracranial pressure, and a particularly high growth rate. Furthermore, the peritumoral edema frequently aggravates the situation, and is responsible for space occupation and brain dysfunction by itself, which makes anti-VEGF-A therapy a plausible strategy (VEGF-A was originally dubbed 'vascular permeability factor', or VPF, highlighting its important role in tumor edema formation). And last but not least, other biological/targeted therapies have not proven effective in glioblastoma, so far. The empirical impression of a treatment benefit by bevacizumab, and also the well-documented increase of overall survival (OS) times of glioblastoma patients since bevacizumab was widely introduced into patient care in 2009, both in clinical and population-based studies  , made many neuro-oncologists believe that their great hopes were justified. The results of all controlled clinical trials, however, speak a somewhat different language. These discrepancies are the subject of ongoing controversies in the field and will be discussed in the following sections.","Angiogenesis is a hallmark of glioblastomas, but anti-angiogenic therapies have fallen short of the initial expectations to relevantly change the clinical course of the disease. Only one agent, the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A antibody bevacizumab, has shown meaningful efficacy in controlled clinical trials in glioblastoma, so far. In primary and recurrent glioblastoma, this efficacy is, however, limited to prolonging progression-free survival and to generating some additional palliative benefits, without affecting overall survival in the total population of glioblastoma patients. Here, we give an overview of the current status of anti-angiogenic therapy in glioblastoma, including how it is currently used in the clinic. Furthermore, we discuss avenues of biomarker research aiming to identify those glioblastoma patients with a higher likelihood of profiting from anti-VEGF- A therapies (and to identify those who will not). Together with novel anti-angiogenic treatment targets and combination regimens under development today, those might improve the current clinical benefits from this class of drugs in glioblastoma.

9123,Current Challenges and Opportunities in Treating Glioblastoma,"--Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, has a high mortality rate despite extensive efforts to develop new treatments. GBM exhibits both intraand intertumor heterogeneity, lending to resistance and eventual tumor recurrence. Large-scale genomic and proteomic analysis of GBM tumors has uncovered potential drug targets. Effective and ""druggable"" targets must be validated to embark on a robust medicinal chemistry campaign culminating in the discovery of clinical candidates. Here, we review recent developments in GBM drug discovery and delivery. To identify GBM drug targets, we performed extensive bioinformatics analysis using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We discovered 20 genes, BOC, CLEC4GP1, ELOVL6, EREG, ESR2, FDCSP, FURIN, FUT8-AS1, GZMB, IRX3, LITAF, NDEL1, NKX3-1, PODNL1, PTPRN, QSOX1, SEMA4F, TH, VEGFC, and C20orf166AS1 that are overexpressed in a subpopulation of GBM patients and correlate with poor survival outcomes. Importantly, nine of these genes exhibit higher expression in GBM versus low-grade glioma and may be involved in disease progression. In this review, we discuss these proteins in the context of GBM disease progression. We also conducted computational multi-parameter optimization to assess the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of small molecules in clinical trials for GBM treatment. Drug delivery in the context of GBM is particularly challenging because the BBB hinders small molecule transport. Therefore, we discuss novel drug delivery methods, including nanoparticles and prodrugs. Given the aggressive nature of GBM and the complexity of targeting the central nervous system, effective treatment options are a major unmet medical need. Identification and validation of biomarkers and drug targets associated with GBM disease progression present an exciting opportunity to improve treatment of this devastating disease.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, has a high mortality rate despite extensive efforts to develop new treatments.

9219,DNA ligase IV is a potential molecular target in ACNU sensitivity,"Nimustine (ACNU) is a chloroethylating agent which was the most active chemotherapy agent used for patients with high-grade gliomas until the introduction of temozolomide, which became the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas in Japan. Since temozolomide was established as the standard first-line therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ACNU has been employed as a salvage chemotherapy agent for recurrent GBM in combination with other drugs. The acting molecular mechanism in ACNU has yet to be elucidated. ACNU is a cross-linking agent which induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The work described here was intended to clarify details in repair pathways which are active in the repair of DNA DSBs induced by ACNU. DSBs are repaired through the homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. Cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used which have deficiencies in DNA DSB repair genes which are involved in HR repair (X-ray repair cross-complementing group 2 [XRCC2] and radiation sensitive mutant 54 [Rad54]), and in NHEJ repair (DNA ligase IV [Lig4]). Cellular sensitivity to ACNU treatment was evaluated with colony forming assays. The most effective molecular target which correlated with ACNU cell sensitivity was Lig4. In addition, it was found that Lig4 small-interference RNA (siRNA) efficiently enhanced cell lethality which was induced by ACNU in human glioblastoma A172 cells. These findings suggest that the down-regulation of Lig4 might provide a useful tool which can be used to increase cell sensitivity in response to ACNU chemotherapy. (Cancer Sci 2010; 101 1881-1885) H igh-grade gliomas remain a therapeutic challenge. In the past, nitrosourea drugs such as nimustine (ACNU) in Japan and central Europe, or carmustine (BCNU) in the USA, were the standard drugs used in addition to radiation. This has changed since the introduction of temozolomide (TMZ) was shown to provide benefits with lower levels of toxicity.  However, a recent meta-analysis has suggested the possibility of a significant survival gain for the use of ACNU for newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas.  The therapeutic value weights of previously used drugs when compared with TMZ and with each other is still unknown. However, the widespread use of TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed disease, primarily glioblastomas, resulted in a reevaluation of nitrosoureas for tumor progression or for tumor recurrences.","Nimustine (ACNU) is a chloroethylating agent which was the most active chemotherapy agent used for patients with high-grade gliomas until the introduction of temozolomide, which became the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas in Japan. Since temozolomide was established as the standard first-line therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ACNU has been employed as a salvage chemotherapy agent for recurrent GBM in combination with other drugs. The acting molecular mechanism in ACNU has yet to be elucidated. ACNU is a cross-linking agent which induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The work described here was intended to clarify details in repair pathways which are active in the repair of DNA DSBs induced by ACNU. DSBs are repaired through the homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. Cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used which have deficiencies in DNA DSB repair genes which are involved in HR repair (X-ray repair cross-complementing group 2 [XRCC2] and radiation sensitive mutant 54 [Rad54]), and in NHEJ repair (DNA ligase IV [Lig4]). Cellular sensitivity to ACNU treatment was evaluated with colony forming assays. The most effective molecular target which correlated with ACNU cell sensitivity was Lig4. In addition, it was found that Lig4 small-interference RNA (siRNA) efficiently enhanced cell lethality which was induced by ACNU in human glioblastoma A172 cells. These findings suggest that the down-regulation of Lig4 might provide a useful tool which can be used to increase cell sensitivity in response to ACNU chemotherapy.

Pharmacokinetics of both agents were performed. Biomarkers of cellular pathway activation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were evaluated before and after administration of dasatinib. PDGFRA and MET amplification, and PDGFRA mutations were studied in tumor samples.Twenty-five patients were enrolled in this study (median age 11.9 years). Eleven patients had DIPG. Glioblastoma accounted for 40% of cases. Dasatinib at 50mg/m(2) and crizotinib at 130mg/m(2) or 100mg/m(2) were poorly tolerated when administered twice daily. Drug administration was then switched to once daily. Dasatinib administered at 50mg/m(2) and crizotinib at 215mg/m(2) once daily was the MTD. Dose-limiting toxicities consisted of diarrhea, fatigue, proteinuria, hyponatremia, rash, and grade 4 neutropenia. Only two patients received therapy for at least 6 months. No objective radiologic responses were observed. Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib and crizotinib were comparable to previous studies. A statistically significant decrease in the ratio of p-AKT/total AKT in PBMC occurred after dasatinib administration. PDGFRA and MET amplification were found in four and two cases, respectively.

9269,Molecular Biology in Pediatric High-Grade Glioma Impact on Prognosis and Treatment,"Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors affecting childhood and the main cause of cancer-related death in children. Gliomas make up approximately 60% of all pediatric brain tumors and about half of these are considered highgrade malignancies. In particular, pediatric glioblastoma (GBM, grade IV WHO) accounts for 15% of all pediatric brain tumours  . Despite efforts to improve treatment, children with high-grade glioma (HGG) still have a dismal outcome with a 5-year survival of less than 20%  .","High-grade gliomas are the main cause of death in children with brain tumours. Despite recent advances in cancer therapy, their prognosis remains poor and the treatment is still challenging. To date, surgery followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide is the standard therapy. However, increasing knowledge of glioma biology is starting to impact drug development towards targeted therapies. The identification of agents directed against molecular targets aims at going beyond the traditional therapeutic approach in order to develop a personalized therapy and improve the outcome of pediatric high-grade gliomas. In this paper, we critically review the literature regarding the genetic abnormalities implicated in the pathogenesis of pediatric malignant gliomas and the current development of molecularly targeted therapies.

9300,Interleukin-13 receptor-directed cytotoxin for malignant glioma therapy from bench to bedside,"Malignant brain tumors, especially glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have a poor prognosis because of their diffuse infiltrative nature and marked cytologic heterogeneity. Almost 35,000 adult Americans are diagnosed with brain tumors each year and 15-35% of these intracranial tumors are diagnosed as GBM  . In the United States, an estimated 13,300 patients die from brain tumors each year  . The standard therapies available for the treatment of these patients include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and a combination of these modalities. Despite the use of these therapies, the median survival time for WHO classified grade IV malignant glioma remains a dismal 47 weeks  . The limited success in anti-glioma therapy has spurred interest in the search for novel and specific antineoplastic agents. According to the National Cancer Institute, NIH website, more than 300 clinical trials are ongoing worldwide using new chemotherapeutic drugs or the combination of new and existing drugs for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The trials of GBM alone constitute 25% of the total. In spite of all these efforts, chemotherapy remains experimental, primarily because of the palliative response, and limited duration of effect. Moreover, the treatment of recurrent brain tumors poses additional problems, and only partially effective modalities are available  . In addition to the standard therapies, immunotherapy has also been attempted for recurrent gliomas   . However, chemotherapy is the only treatment option currently available for this disease.","Central nervous system malignant neoplasias, in particular, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have defied all current therapeutic modalities. New therapies involving tumor targeting approach are being explored. This approach relies on the identification of unique or over-expressed cell surface receptors or antigens on tumor cells. In that regard, we have identified receptor for an immune regulatory cytokine, interleukin-13 (IL-13), which is over-expressed on human malignant glioma cell lines and primary tumor cell cultures. To target IL-13 receptors (IL-13R) for cancer therapy, we have developed a recombinant fusion protein composed of IL-13 and a mutated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin ( IL13-PE38QQR or IL-13 cytotoxin). The IL-13 cytotoxin was found to be highly selective and potent in killing human GBM cells in vitro while normal cells including immune cells, endothelial cells and normal brain cells were generally spared the cytotoxic effect of IL-13 cytotoxin. This is because these cells either expressed none or expressed low levels of IL-13R.Consistent with in vitro cytotoxic activity, IL-13 cytotoxin mediated remarkable anti-tumor activity to human glioma in animal xenograft models. The direct injection of IL-13 cytotoxin into subcutaneous human GBM tumors grown in nude mice produced complete and durable regression of established tumors. Intravenous and intraperitoneal administration of IL-13 cytotoxin also reduced tumor burden significantly with fewer complete responders. All animals tolerated therapy well with minimal toxicity to vital organs. Pre-clinical safety and toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats and monkeys. Systemic administration of IL-13 cytotoxin appeared to be well tolerated at high doses (up to 50 mug/kg). Intrabrain parenchyma administration of IL-13 cytotoxin at doses up to 100 mug/ml was very well tolerated without any evidence of gross or microscopic necrosis, whereas at 500 mug/ml dose, localized necrosis was observed in normal rat brain. Based on these encouraging pre-clinical studies, three Phase I/II clinical trials in adults with malignant glioma have been initiated. The first clinical trial involves convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of IL-13 cytotoxin into recurrent malignant glioma. This route of IL-13 cytotoxin administration appears to be fairly well tolerated with no neurotoxicity. The second clinical trial involves infusion of IL-13 cytotoxin by CED following tumor resection. The initial stage of the second study assessed histologic effect of drug administered prior to resection. In third one, IL-13 cytotoxin is infused by CED followed by tumor resection. All three clinical trials are currently ongoing.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A1026242432647.pdf

Despite its prevalence, and the resultant abundance of organized clinical investigation over several decades, GBM remains a challenging therapeutic entity from its initial diagnosis to its nearly inevitable recurrence. Multiple treatment modalities are under active investigation, offering limited promise to improving overall survival in this patient population  . Drugs treating this disease through novel mechanisms are urgently needed.","Improving overall survival in recurrent glioblastoma remains a challenge, and drugs acting by unique mechanisms are urgently required. Ixazomib is an orally-administered proteasome inhibitor used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone to treat patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. However, ixazomib's ability to reach brain tumors has not been studied during its development. The aim of the present study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02630030) was to establish and quantify ixazomib's presence in glioblastoma. The present study investigated 3 patients with recurrent glioblastoma after administration of oral ixazomib citrate (MLN 9708) at a fixed 4.0 mg dose within a 3-hpreoperative window. A total of 2 blood samples were taken from each patient at the time of incision, tumor sampling and closure. Brain tumor samples were collected during tumor resection. These samples were then used to measure the plasma and brain tumor tissue concentration of the biologically-active form of ixazomib (MLN 2238). Patient 1 had plasma concentrations of ixazomib averaging 26.2, 21.8 and 15.3 ng/ml at incision, tumor sampling and closure, respectively. The brain tumor tissue concentration was 7.88 ng/g. Patient 2 had the same interval and brain tumor tissue measurements of 19.0, 18.0 and 8.93 ng/ml, and 2.03 ng/g. Patient 3 had plasma concentration interval measurements of 25.6, 36.2 and 28.7 ng/ml. Multiple brain tumor tissue samples were taken in patient 3, with an average tissue ixazomib concentration of 3.37 ng/g. Ixazomib was found at plasma concentrations commensurate with its previously established pharmacokinetic profile without clinically relevant drug-related adverse events. Ixazomib reaches glioblastoma tissues at measurable concentrations at the time of tumor resection, confirming target tissue delivery.

9381,Exciting New Advances in Neuro-Oncology The Avenue to a Cure for Malignant Glioma,"despite aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapies. This puts the physicians in charge of delivering dismal news to the patients and families in a difficult position. Much skill is needed to progressively deliver this negative message with tact, and balance it with the known fact that outcome is individually variable and a small fraction of patients do much better than expected. Fortunately, there is optimism in that this situation is likely to change within the next 0 years. Tremendous new discoveries have been made in basic and translational research and there is unprecedented new knowledge that has been acquired in recent years. Summarizing these advances on various fronts is straightforward and the following comments help to put them in perspective. Radiotherapy has been of key importance to the treatment of these lesions for decades. Although the ionizing radiation itself has not changed, the ability to focus the beam and tailor it to the irregular contours of brain tumors and minimize the dose to nearby critical structures with intensity-modulated or image-guided techniques has improved greatly.  The use of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel; Eisai Inc, Woodcliff Lake, NJ) after surgical resection of newly diagnosed glioblastomas and recurrent malignant gliomas improves the time to disease progression and overall survival in selected patients.   The use of temozolomide concurrently and after radiotherapy has clearly improved overall survival and has the advantage of wide applicability because of its relatively simple administration and favorable toxicity profile compared with older agents such as carmustine.  Targeted therapies based on our understanding of the biology of these lesions are finding their way into clinical practice, as evidenced by the recent approval of bevacizumab, an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), for the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma.","Malignant gliomas are the most common and deadly brain tumors. Nevertheless, survival for patients with glioblastoma, the most aggressive glioma, although individually variable, has improved from an average of 10 months to 14 months after diagnosis in the last 5 years due to improvements in the standard of care. Radiotherapy has been of key importance to the treatment of these lesions for decades, and the ability to focus the beam and tailor it to the irregular contours of brain tumors and minimize the dose to nearby critical structures with intensity-modulated or image-guided techniques has improved greatly. Temozolomide, an alkylating agent with simple oral administration and a favorable toxicity profile, is used in conjunction with and after radiotherapy. Newer surgical techniques, such as fluorescence-guided resection and neuroendoscopic approaches, have become important in the management of malignant gliomas. Furthermore, new discoveries are being made in basic and translational research, which are likely to improve this situation further in the next 10 years. These include agents that block 1 or more of the disordered tumor proliferation signaling pathways, and that overcome resistance to already existing treatments. Targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic therapy with antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (bevacizumab) are finding their way into clinical practice. Large-scale research efforts are ongoing to provide a comprehensive understanding of all the genetic alterations and gene expression changes underlying glioma formation. These have already refined the classification of glioblastoma into 4 distinct molecular entities that may lead to different treatment regimens. The role of cancer stem-like cells is another area of active investigation. There is definite hope that by 2020, new cocktails of drugs will be available to target the key molecular pathways involved in gliomas and reduce their mortality and morbidity, a positive development for patients, their families, and medical professionals alike.

9453,Poor drug distribution as a possible explanation for the results of the PRECISE trial Clinical article,"in Phase II studies before Phase III studies are undertak en, drug distribution by CED into the brain is difficult to monitor. This is because many of the agents administered by intracerebral CED have a high molecular weight or are used in such low concentrations, and there are lim ited opportunities to monitor or predict drug distribution in the brain by CED. Clearly, failure to deliver drug to tumor-infiltrated tissue might explain apparent failure of an active agent in these randomized clinical trials.","Object. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a novel intracerebral drug delivery technique with considerable promise for delivering therapeutic agents throughout the CNS. Despite this promise, Phase III clinical trials employing CED have failed to meet clinical end points. Although this may be due to inactive agents or a failure to rigorously validate drug targets, the authors have previously demonstrated that catheter positioning plays a major role in drug distribution using this technique. The purpose of the present work was to retrospectively analyze the expected drug distribution based on catheter positioning data available from the CED arm of the PRECISE trial.s. Data on catheter positioning from all patients randomized to the CED arm of the PRECISE trial were available for analyses. BrainLAB iPlan Flow software was used to estimate the expected drug distribution.. Only 49.8% of catheters met all positioning criteria. Still, catheter positioning score (hazard ratio 0.93, p = 0.043) and the number of optimally positioned catheters (hazard ratio 0.72, p = 0.038) had a significant effect on progression-free survival. Estimated coverage of relevant target volumes was low, however, with only 20.1% of the 2-cm penumbra surrounding the resection cavity covered on average. Although tumor location and resection cavity volume had no effect on coverage volume, estimations of drug delivery to relevant target volumes did correlate well with catheter score (p < 0.003), and optimally positioned catheters had larger coverage volumes (p < 0.002). Only overall survival (p = 0.006) was higher for investigators considered experienced after adjusting for patient age and Karnofsky Performance Scale score.. The potential efficacy of drugs delivered by CED may be severely constrained by ineffective delivery in many patients. Routine use of software algorithms and alternative catheter designs and infusion parameters may improve the efficacy of drugs delivered by CED.

Chemoradiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide, is the standard treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Adding other active agents may enhance treatment efficacy.s. The primary objective of this factorial phase II study was to determine if one of 3 potential chemotherapy agents added to dose-dense temozolomide (ddTMZ) improves progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. A prior phase I trial established the safety of combining ddTMZ with isotretinoin, celecoxib, and/or thalidomide. Adults with good performance status and no evidence of progression post chemoradiation were randomized into 8 arms ddTMZ alone (7 days on/7 days off) or doublet, triplet, and quadruplet combinations with isotretinoin, celecoxib, and thalidomide.. The study enrolled 155 participants with a median age of 53 years (range, 18-84 y). None of the agents demonstrated improved PFS when compared with arms not containing that specific agent. There was no difference in PFS for triplet compared with doublet regimens, although a trend for improved overall survival (OS) was seen (20.1 vs 17.0 months, P=.15). Compared with ddTMZ, the ddTMZ + isotretinoin doublet had worse PFS (10.5 vs 6.5 months, P=.043) and OS (21.2 vs 11.7 months, P=.037). Trends were also seen for worse outcomes with isotretinoin-containing regimens, but there was no impact with celecoxib or thalidomide combinations. Treatment was well tolerated with expected high rates of lymphopenia.. The results do not establish a benefit for these combinations but indicate that adding isotretinoin to ddTMZ may be detrimental.

9519,"G2/M inhibitors as pharmacotherapeutic opportunities for glioblastoma the old, the new, and the future","For many years, tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) were primarily categorized according to histopathological criteria determined under microscopic observation, where similarities and phenotypic differences depended on cellular origin and their presumed levels of differentiation. In particular, gliomas are diffusely infiltrating glial cell tumors that are responsible for 80% of malignant tumors initiated in the brain and have been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) depending on the type of the affected glial cell, thus integrating the nomenclature with grading system  . Histological diagnosis is correlated with tumor grade on a scale of I to IV based on how normal or abnormal the cells appear  . Accordingly, a grade IV astrocytoma (also called ""glioblastoma"", ""glioblastoma multiforme"", ""grade IV glioblastoma"", and ""GBM"") represents the most common and most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor, with 3 per 00,000 people diagnosed every year . GBM is histopathologically characterized by brisk mitotic activity, cellular and nuclear atypia, vascular thrombosis, and microvascular hyperproliferation and necrosis, with 80% being primary or de novo occurring though malignant transformation from lower-grade gliomas (sometimes referred to as secondary GBMs)  .","Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the deadliest tumors and has a median survival of 3 months if left untreated. Despite advances in rationally targeted pharmacological approaches, the clinical care of GBM remains palliative in intent. Since the majority of altered signaling cascades involved in cancer establishment and progression eventually affect cell cycle progression, an alternative approach for cancer therapy is to develop innovative compounds that block the activity of crucial molecules needed by tumor cells to complete cell division. In this context, we review promising ongoing and future strategies for GBM therapeutics aimed towards G2/M inhibition such as anti-microtubule agents and targeted therapy against G2/M regulators like cyclin-dependent kinases, Aurora inhibitors, PLK1, BUB, 1, and BUBR1, and survivin. Moreover, we also include investigational agents in the preclinical and early clinical settings. Although several drugs were shown to be gliotoxic, most of them have not yet entered therapeutic trials. The use of either single exposure or a combination with novel compounds may lead to treatment alternatives for GBM patients in the near future.",http//www.cancerbiomed.org/index.php/cocr/article/download/1289/1286
9578,Convection-Enhanced Delivery in Malignant Gliomas A Review of Toxicity and Efficacy,"Despite the fast development of several modalities for cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, pharmaceutical agents available for brain tumor treatment remain rare. The failure of the application of these agents in brain tumor is partially due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents them from entering the tumor site. This problem led to the development of strategies to open temporarily the BBB, including osmotic and ultrasonic BBB disruption     . During the osmotic BBB disruption procedure, hyperosmotic agents such as mannitol are infused and a temporary cell membrane retraction is induced, creating a physical opening between the endothelium cells    . In the case of ultrasonic BBB disruption, pulsed ultrasound is applied in combination with infusion of microbubbles to disrupt the BBB, thus increasing the intratumoral concentration of the therapeutic agents  . Rather than disrupting the BBB, another strategy consists of bypassing the BBB. In the early 1990s, Oldfield and his research team proposed a new technique to traverse the BBB, convection-enhanced delivery (CED)  , by which interstitial infusion of the agent by a syringe pump creates a pressure gradient, permitting enhanced distribution of the brain. The technical parameters of the CED procedure have been reviewed by Allard E. et al.  .","Malignant gliomas are undifferentiated or anaplastic gliomas. They remain incurable with a multitude of modalities, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and alternating electric field therapy. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a local treatment that can bypass the blood-brain barrier and increase the tumor uptake of therapeutic agents, while decreasing exposure to healthy tissues. Considering the multiple choices of drugs with different antitumor mechanisms, the supra-additive effect of concomitant radiation and chemotherapy, CED appears as a promising modality for the treatment of brain tumors. In this review, the CED-related toxicities are summarized and classified into immediate, early, and late side effects based on the time of onset, and local and systemic toxicities based on the location of toxicity. The efficacies of CED of various therapeutic agents including targeted antitumor agents, chemotherapeutic agents, radioisotopes, and immunomodulators are covered. The phase III trial PRECISE compares CED of IL13-PE38QQR, an interleukin-13 conjugated to Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, to Gliadel (R) Wafer, a polymer loaded with carmustine. However, in this case, CED had no significant median survival improvement (11.3 months vs. 10 months) in patients with recurrent glioblastomas. In phase II studies, CED of recombinant poliovirus (PVSRIPO) had an overall survival of 21% vs. 14% for the control group at 24 months, and 21% vs. 4% at 36 months. CED of Tf-diphtheria toxin had a response rate of 35% in recurrent malignant gliomas patients. On the other hand, the TGF-beta 2 inhibitor Trabedersen, HSV-1-tk ganciclovir, and radioisotope I-131-chTNT-1/B mAb had a limited response rate. With this treatment, patients who received CED of the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel and immunomodulator, oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG-ODN), experienced intolerable toxicity. Toward the end of this article, an ideal CED treatment procedure is proposed and the methods for quality assurance of the CED procedure are discussed.",https//downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jo/2019/9342796.pdf

Furthermore, the effects of miR-181a-5p on the invasive ability of GBM cells were analyzed using an in vitro invasion assay. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out to determine whether overexpression of miR-181a-5p can promote the apoptotic rate of GBM cells. RT-qPCR and western blotting were employed to detect the effects of miR-181a-5p on mRNA and protein expression of FBX011. miR-181a-5p exhibited low expression in resistant GBM cell lines and recurrent tumor tissues. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were utilized to detect luciferase activity to verify the targeted regulatory association between miR-181a-5p and FBXO11. Upregulation of miR-181a-5p promoted the sensitivity of GBM cells to temozolomide (TMZ), increased the apoptotic rate of GBM cells and significantly inhibited the invasive and migratory capacities of GBM cells. In drug-resistant glioma cells, compared with the miR-negative control group and the blank group, the expression of miR-181a-5p was significantly upregulated (P<0.01), while the expression of FBXO11 protein was downregulated. miR-181a-5p increased the sensitivity of GBM cells to TMZ. miR-181a-5p significantly inhibited the migratory and invasive capacities of GBM cells. miR-181a-5p may become a novel effective target for the treatment of GBM. The results of dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-181a-5p could target the 3<prime>-untranslated region of FBXO11. The underlying mechanism may be targeted inhibition of FBXO11 gene expression, or may be associated with apoptosis.",https//www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ol.2020.12098/download
9632,The PIK3CA Gene as a Mutated Target for Cancer Therapy,"Insults to the genome are a hallmark of cancer and a driving force in carcinogenesis. These genomic alterations are an obvious difference between normal and cancerous cells, which provide an opportunity to exploit them as potential targets for therapeutics. Recently, successful clinical trials of imatinib, gefitinib/erlotinib, and trastuzumab, which are specific for BCR-ABL translocations  , epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations   , and HER2/ neu amplifications [4-6] respectively, have illustrated the ability to develop drugs that target genetic abnormalities and opened the possibility for future streamlined therapies based on the genomic landscape of an individual's cancer.","The development of targeted therapies with true specificity for cancer relies upon exploiting differences between cancerous and normal cells. Genetic and genomic alterations including somatic mutations, translocations, and amplifications have served as recent examples of how such differences can be exploited as effective drug targets. Small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies directed against the protein products of these genetic anomalies have led to cancer therapies with high specificity and relatively low toxicity. Recently, our group and others have demonstrated that somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene occur at high frequency in breast and other cancers. Moreover, the majority of mutations occur at three hotspots, making these ideal targets for therapeutic development. Here we review the literature on PIK3CA mutations in cancer, as well as existing data on PIK3CA inhibitors and inhibitors of downstream effectors for potential use as targeted cancer therapeutics.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831175/pdf/nihms165760.pdf
9648,Impairment of Glioma Stem Cell Survival and Growth by a Novel Inhibitor for Survivin-Ran Protein Complex,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary tumor in the central nervous system (CNS), is an aggressive and highly lethal malignancy  . Despite the use of surgical resection in conjunction with current adjuvant therapies, the median survival period of GBM patients is only 14.6 months (2). To overcome this devastating disease, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that govern glioma cell survival and proliferation."," Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating disease. Recent studies suggest that the stem cell properties of GBM contribute to the development of therapy resistance.Experimental Design The expression of Survivin and Ran was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with GBM tissues, and quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR and immunocytochemistry with patient-derived GBM sphere cultures. With a computational structure-based drug design, 11 small-molecule compounds were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as inhibitor candidates for the molecular interaction of Survivin protein. The molecular mechanism of the lead compound, LLP-3, was determined by Western blot, ELISA, in situ proximity ligation assay, and immunocytochemistry. The effects of LLP-3 treatment on GSCs were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was carried out to compare Survivin expression in tissues from 44 newly diagnosed and 31 recurrent post-chemoradiation GBM patients. Lastly, the sensitivities of temozolomide-resistant GBM spheres to LLP-3 were evaluated in vitro. Survivin and Ran were strongly expressed in GBM tissues, particularly in the perivasculature, and also in patient-derived GSC cultures. LLP-3 treatment disrupted the Survivin-Ran protein complex in cancer cells and abolished the growth of patient-derived GBM spheres in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition was dependent on caspase activity and associated with p53 status of cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that Survivin expression is significantly increased in recurrent GBM compared with newly diagnosed tumors, and temozolomide-resistant GBM spheres exhibited high sensitivities to LLP-3 treatment. Disruption of the Survivin-Ran complex by LLP-3 abolishes survival and growth of GSCs both in vitro and in vivo, indicating an attractive novel therapeutic approach for GBM.

9681,Antiangiogenic therapy of brain tumors the role of bevacizumab,"Angiogenesis means formation of new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature, and physiologically it contributes to organ growth, wound healing, and response to stimuli such as hypoxia and inflammation  . Angiogenesis is a complex mechanism regulated by several stimulatory (pro-angiogenic) and inhibitory (antiangiogenic) factors, that coexist in a finely tuned balance, and it is one of the hallmarks of the malignancy  . Small tumors can usually get adequate nutrients from the surroundings by diffusion, but larger tumors need new blood vessels to survive and grow and these findings made Judah Folkman  suggest in 1971 that the inhibition of angiogenesis could be an effective antitumor strategy.","Angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, including brain tumors. Malignant gliomas have the highest degree of vascular proliferation among solid tumors; thus, angiogenic pathways represent an attractive target to interfere with tumor growth. Up to date VEGF pathway targeting with specific drugs has yielded interesting therapeutics results. In particular bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A, has shown clinical activity in malignant gliomas, especially glioblastomas, in terms of a high response rate on MRI and a significant increase in progression-free survival.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10072-014-1627-6.pdf
9717,The TNF receptor family member Fn14 is highly expressed in recurrent glioblastoma and in GBM patient- derived xenografts with acquired temozolomide resistance,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly adult primary brain cancer. There are approximately 15 000 new cases of GBM per year in the USA.  2 The current standard of care for patients with GBM consists of maximal safe surgical resection followed by high-dose radiation and concomitant oral chemotherapy using the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ).  4 Despite this combination treatment strategy, tumor recurrence is nearly universal and the median overall survival of GBM patients is ~18 months after diagnosis.  4 GBM is one of the most difficult to treat human cancers because extensive tumor cell invasion into surrounding functioning brain tissue prevents complete surgical removal of tumor cells and limits cytotoxic treatments, which risk injuring nearby neural components.      Recurrent GBM tumors tend to be more aggressive and treatment resistant than their primary (ie, newly diagnosed) counterparts,  10 and generally only 20%-30% of patients with these tumors are considered eligible for repeat surgery. 10 Although there have been numerous clinical trials testing chemotherapeutics and molecularly targeted agents in the recurrent disease setting, 11 only 2 pharmaceutical treatments have been approved for recurrent GBM Gliadel, a surgically implanted, biodegradable chemotherapy (carmustine) wafer, 12 and bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the pro-angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor-A. 13 Neither of these treatments was specifically designed to treat unique features of recurrent GBM or has had a major impact on patient survival. 10 A better understanding of recurrent GBM biology would offer new opportunities for tailoring treatments following standard-of-care chemoradiation therapy. Toward this goal, recent genomic and transcriptomic studies have shown that this therapy can promote the evolution of hypermutated, therapy-resistant tumor cell populations, frequently subclonal and stemlike in nature, that drive tumor recurrence.        In particular, TMZ treatment introduces genetic alterations and biological changes into GBM cells, with a high frequency of mutations affecting DNA mismatch repair,  20 tumor suppressor,   2 22 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway 1 22 genes.",". Glioblastoma (GBM) is a difficult to treat brain cancer that nearly uniformly recurs, and recurrent tumors are largely therapy resistant. Our prior work has demonstrated an important role for the tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) receptor fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) in GBM pathobiology. In this study, we investigated Fn14 expression in recurrent GBM and in the setting of temozolomide (TMZ) resistance.s. Fn14 mRNA expression levels in nonneoplastic brain, primary (newly diagnosed) GBM, and recurrent GBM (post-chemotherapy and radiation) specimens were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal. Immunohistochemistry was performed using nonneoplastic brain, patient-matched primary and recurrent GBM, and gliosarcoma (GSM) specimens to examine Fn14 protein levels. Western blot analysis was used to compare Fn14 expression in parental TMZ-sensitive or matched TMZ-resistant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) established from primary or recurrent tumor samples. The migratory capacity of control and Fn14-depleted TMZ-resistant GBM cells was assessed using the transwell migration assay.. We found that Fn14 is more highly expressed in recurrent GBM tumors than their matched primary GBM counterparts. Fn14 expression is also significantly elevated in GSM tumors. GBM PDX cells with acquired TMZ resistance have higher Fn14 levels and greater migratory capacity than their corresponding parental TMZ-sensitive cells, and the migratory difference is due, at least in part, to Fn14 expression in the TMZ-resistant cells.. This study demonstrates that the Fn14 gene is highly expressed in recurrent GBM, GSM, and TMZresistant GBM PDX tumors. These findings suggest that Fn14 may be a valuable therapeutic target or drug delivery portal for treatment of recurrent GBM and GSM patients.",https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6140775/pdf/noy063.pdf
9736,Molecular Heterogeneity of Glioblastoma and its Clinical Relevance,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain malignancy in adults and one of the most aggressive cancers. It accounts for 16 % of all primary brain tumors, and represents half of gliomas. The incidence of glioblastomas increases with age, and the rates are highest in the 75 to 84 years old age-group. The relative survival estimates for glioblastoma are quite low less than 5 % of patients survive 5 years post-diagnosis  . It may involve any neuroanatomical structure, but is most commonly located in the cerebral hemispheres. Histologically, glioblastoma is a diffuse, grade IV glioma of the astrocytic lineage (WHO Classification of Tumors of the CNS, 4th edn, 2007) and is characterized by the presence of pleomorphic cells, mitotic activity, intravascular microthrombi, necrosis with or without cellular pseudopalisading and microvascular proliferation. Based on the presence or absence of a precursor lesion, two similar morphological subtypes are distinguished primary glioblastoma is the most common type (∼90 %) which arises de novo, without evidence of a precursor lesion, and typically occurs in older adults (>50 years), while secondary glioblastoma evolves from a pre-existent, lower-grade astrocytoma (WHO grades II or III)  .","Glioblastoma is the most common intracranial malignancy and constitutes about 50 % of all gliomas. Both inter-tumor and intra-tumor histological heterogeneity had been recognized by the early 1980-ies. Recent works using novel molecular platforms provided molecular definitions of these tumors. Based on comprehensive genomic sequence analyses, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) cataloged somatic mutations and recurrent copy number alterations in glioblastoma. Robust transcriptome and epigenome studies also revealed inter-tumor heterogeneity. Integration and cluster analyses of multi-dimensional genomic data lead to a new classification of glioblastoma tumors into subtypes with distinct biological features and clinical correlates. However, multiple observations also revealed tumor area-specific patterns of genomic imbalance. In addition, genetic alterations have been identified that were common to all areas analyzed and other alterations that were area specific. Analyses of intra-tumor transcriptome variations revealed that in more than half of the examined cases, fragments from the same tumor mass could be classified into at least two different glioblastoma molecular subgroups. Intra-tumor heterogeneity of molecular genetic profiles in glioblastoma may explain the difficulties encountered in the validation of oncologic biomarkers, and contribute to a biased selection of patients for single target therapies, treatment failure or drug resistance. In this paper, we summarize the currently available literature concerning inter- and intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas, and call attention to the importance of this topic in relation to the growing efforts in routine molecular diagnostics and personalized therapy.",https//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12253-014-9833-3.pdf
9771,"Bevacizumab in high-grade gliomas a review of its uses, toxicity assessment, and future treatment challenges","High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are lethal tumors with a poor prognosis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, HGGs include all grade III/IV primary brain tumors of astrocytic, oligodendroglial, and mixed cellular lineage. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a WHO grade IV astrocytoma that accounts for 50%-60% of adult astrocytomas and about 1%-15% of intracranial neoplasms.   Anaplastic gliomas (AGs) (WHO grade III) include anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors.  In this review, the term HGG is used to specifically discuss the role of bevacizumab (BEV) in WHO grade IV tumors or GBMs, with specific reference made to grade III tumors where necessary.","High-grade gliomas continue to have dismal prognosis despite advances made in understanding the molecular genetics, signaling pathways, cytoskeletal dynamics, and the role of stem cells in gliomagenesis. Conventional treatment approaches, including surgery, radiotherapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy, have been used with limited success. Therapeutic advances using molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and others such as dietary treatments have not been able to halt tumor progression and disease-related death. High-grade gliomas (World Health Organization grades III/IV) are histologically characterized by cellular and nuclear atypia, neoangiogenesis, and necrosis. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, a molecular mediator, plays a key role in vascular proliferation and tumor survival. Targeting vascular endothelial growth factor has demonstrated promising results, with improved quality of life and progression-free survival. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a single agent in recurrent glioblastoma and is associated with manageable toxicity.

9821,Convection-enhanced delivery of SN-38-loaded polymeric micelles (NK012) enables consistent distribution of SN-38 and is effective against rodent intracranial brain tumor models,"Malignant brain tumors, such as glioblastoma, remain the most difficult neoplasms to treat despite intensive multimodal treatment including surgical resection, radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy requires high doses of many anticancer drugs because of poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier   . Consequently, systemic side effects are the limiting factor in chemotherapeutic protocols for patients with brain tumor, and emphasize the need for efficient, specific methods of delivery in the treatment of human glioblastoma.","Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of therapeutic agents is a promising local delivery technique that has been extensively studied as a treatment for CNS diseases over the last two decades. One continuing challenge of CED is accurate and consistent delivery of the agents to the target. The present study focused on a new type of therapeutic agent, NK012, a novel SN-38-loaded polymeric micelle. Local delivery profiles of NK012 and SN-38 were studied using rodent brain and intracranial rodent brain tumor models. First, the cytotoxicity of NK012 against glioma cell lines was determined in vitro. Proliferations of glioma cells were significantly reduced after exposure to NK012. Then, the distribution and local toxicity after CED delivery of NK012 and SN-38 were evaluated in vivo. Volume of distribution of NK012 after CED was much larger than that of SN-38. Histological examination revealed minimum brain tissue damage in rat brains after delivery of 40 mg NK012 but severe damage with SN-38 at the same dose. Subsequently, the efficacy of NK012 delivered via CED was tested in 9L and U87MG rodent orthotopic brain tumor models. CED of NK012 displayed excellent efficacy in the 9L and U87MG orthotopic brain tumor models. Furthermore, NK012 and gadolinium diamide were co-delivered via CED to monitor the NK012 distribution using MRI. Volume of NK012 distribution evaluated by histology and MRI showed excellent agreement. CED of NK012 represents an effective treatment option for malignant gliomas.

9853,Neurotoxicity of Biologically Targeted Agents in Pediatric Cancer Trials,"An increasingly robust body of literature has demonstrated adverse neurologic effects from cancer treatments, including surgery, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, and radiation. At the same time, significant advances in the understanding of the molecular pathways involved in tumorigenesis and proliferation have lead to the development of biologically targeted therapeutics. A recent focus of basic and translational cancer research has involved developing and testing therapeutic agents targeting extracellular, cell surface, and intracellular molecules that contribute to the development and progression of cancers and the resistance of tumors to conventional therapies  . Delivered individually or combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, molecularly targeted therapies have produced significant responses in certain types of cancer. In other malignancies, including brain tumors, cures have been elusive, but hope remains that current and future trials with rational combinations of therapies will be successful. The goal of targeted therapy with biologic agents involves selectively attacking the cancer cell and its supportive environment while sparing normal tissue, resulting in both increased efficacy and fewer short-term and long-term side effects, compared with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As these biologic agents are implemented in clinical trials, clinicians and clinician-researchers must be mindful of the potential for new or additional adverse effects, including neurotoxicity and adverse neurocognitive sequelae, particularly in children.","Biologically targeted agents offer the promise of delivering specific anticancer effects while limiting damage to healthy tissue, including the central and peripheral nervous systems. During the past 5-10 years, these agents were examined in preclinical and adult clinical trials, and are used with increasing frequency in children with cancer. This review evaluates current knowledge about neurotoxicity from biologically targeted anticancer agents, particularly those in pediatric clinical trials. For each drug, neurotoxicity data are reviewed in adult (particularly studies of brain tumors) and pediatric studies when available. Overall, these agents are well tolerated, with few serious neurotoxic effects. Data from younger patients are limited, and more neurotoxicity may occur in the pediatric population because these agents target pathways that control not only tumorigenesis but also neural maturation. Further investigation is needed into long-term neurologic effects, particularly in children. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

9891,Disulfiram when Combined with Copper Enhances the Therapeutic Effects of Temozolomide for the Treatment of Glioblastoma,"Grade IV glioma and glioblastoma are the most lethal and aggressive forms of brain tumors in adults. Despite treatment advances combining maximal surgical resection with radiotherapy and concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy (temozolomide), patient prognosis remains disappointing and survival is limited to 14.6 months with few cases of long-term survivors  . Current barriers to successful treatment include their complex tumor heterogeneity, diffuse invasiveness, and the presence of a subpopulation of glioma cells with stem-like properties, herein termed brain tumor-initiating cells (BTIC; refs.   , that have been shown to confer resistance to conventional therapies, such as radio-and chemotherapies      . Thus, to improve clinical outcomes, therapeutic agents should target both the infiltrative and tumor-initiating disease reservoirs."," Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal cancers in humans, and with existing therapy, survival remains at 14.6 months. Current barriers to successful treatment include their infiltrative behavior, extensive tumor heterogeneity, and the presence of a stem-like population of cells, termed brain tumor-initiating cells (BTIC) that confer resistance to conventional therapies.Experimental Design To develop therapeutic strategies that target BTICs, we focused on a repurposing approach that explored already-marketed (clinically approved) drugs for therapeutic potential against patient-derived BTICs that encompass the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of glioblastoma observed clinically. Using a high-throughput in vitro drug screen, we found that montelukast, clioquinol, and disulfiram (DSF) were cytotoxic against a large panel of patient-derived BTICs. Of these compounds, disulfiram, an off-patent drug previously used to treat alcoholism, in the presence of a copper supplement, showed low nanomolar efficacy in BTICs including those resistant to temozolomide and the highly infiltrative quiescent stem-like population. Low dose DSF-Cu significantly augmented temozolomide activity in vitro, and importantly, prolonged in vivo survival in patient-derived BTIC models established from both newly diagnosed and recurrent tumors. Moreover, we found that in addition to acting as a potent proteasome inhibitor, DSF-Cu functionally impairs DNA repair pathways and enhances the effects ofDNAalkylating agents and radiation. These observations suggest that DSF-Cu inhibits proteasome activity and augments the therapeutic effects of DNA-damaging agents (temozolomide and radiation). DSF-Cu should be considered as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma in both newly diagnosed and recurrent settings.

9937,Cilengitide Treatment for Malignant Glioma Current Status and Future Direction,"Malignant gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor. Their treatment has involved a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, yet these modalities rarely extend the life of the patient to more than one year from diagnosis. Several modalities have been and continue to be tested for the treatment of these tumors. Malignant gliomas remain a challenging tumor to treat, and a variety of experimental therapies have failed to show effectiveness in clinical trials.  The pathophysiological processes of angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion play pivotal roles in glioma development and growth from the earliest stages.  The formation of abnormal tumor vasculature and glioma cell invasion along white matter tracts are believed to be the major reasons for the resistance of these tumors to treatment. This angiogenesis or invasion causes the production of many different angiogenic or invasive factors, respectively, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hepatocytes growth factor, integrins, etc. Among these factors, the overexpression of integrins is well documented.   Emerging evidence indicates that integrins promote the adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis of glioblastoma.  Rats bearing brain tumors were treated with 30 mg of cilengitide or with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3 days after intracerebral glioma cell implantation. Rats were injected with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated dextran via the tail vein 5 minutes before they were killed on day 10 after glioma cell injection. Brains were harvested and sectioned for analysis. A Fluorescence microscopy images of FITC-dextran-perfused tumor blood vessels derived from rats treated with PBS (left) or cilengitide (right).

","Malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor and accounts for the majority of diagnoses. Treatment has involved a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, yet these modalities rarely extend the life of the patient to more than one year from diagnosis. Integrins are expressed in tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells, and are important in angiogenesis and invasion in glioma. alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 integrins regulate cell adhesion, and inhibitors of these integrins suppress tumor growth in certain pre-clinical models. Several integrin-targeted drugs are in clinical trials as potential compounds for the treatment of cancer. Among them, cilengitide is a novel integrin antagonist for the treatment of glioblastoma. The multimodal anti-glioma effects are based on its cytotoxic, anti-angiogenic, anti-invasive, and synergetic effects. Preclinical studies showed a promising synergy between cilengitide and radiochemotherapy in order to normalize tumor vasculature and attenuate tumor invasion. Cilengitide is currently being assessed in phase III trials for patients with glioblastoma multiforme and in phase II trials for other types of cancers, demonstrating promising therapeutic outcomes to date. The results of these and other clinical studies are expected with great hope and interest. A more clear understanding of the benefits and pitfalls of each approach can then lead to the design of strategies to derive maximal benefit from these therapies.",https//www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/nmc/52/8/52_2012-0097/_pdf
