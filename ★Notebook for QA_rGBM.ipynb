Despite definitive data, standard of care guidance for managing patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma is evolving. The diffusely infiltrative pattern of progression might be associated with a slower cause of the disease, as it has been suggested by radiological patterns of recurrence of patients treated with bevacizumab. The 6-month pfs rate (pfs6) is the optimal end point for treatment of recurrent gliOBlastoma. Participation in clinical trials is encouraged for the treatment of this type of cancer.
